"Socio-economic, built environment, and mobility conditions associated with crime: a study of multiple cities",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7431538/,import contractions,"Nowadays, 23% of the world population lives in multi-million cities. In these metropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding what factors influence urban crime in big cities is a pressing need. Seminal studies analyse crime records through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with ecological factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning methods have provided informed crime prediction over time. However, previous studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering only a limited number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large in a single city. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across cultures and cities is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to explore how violent and property crimes are related not only to socio-economic factors but also to the built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of neighbourhoods. To that end, we analyse crime at small areas and integrate multiple open data sources with mobile phone traces to compare how the different factors correlate with crime in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogotá, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence of crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However, we show that the socio-ecological factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime very differently from one city to another. Thus there is clearly no “one fits all” model.","We also found some commonalities in all the cities. We find that corehoods with high disadvantage and ethnic diversity but, surprisingly, smaller blocks have higher crime activity. While in the core we find that the presence of Shops, Food POIs, and population (both residential and ambient) correlates positively with criminal activity. These results resonate with literature showing that the presence of POIs and ambient population increase crime due to a higher number of potential targets and offenders in an area. Additionally, we find that corehood attractiveness has a strong connection with crimes, suggesting that the presence of people that do not live nor work in the area might influence crime. This result is in contrast with literature based on Jacobs’ theory. but resonate with Oscar Newman’s one arguing that a high number of visitors results in higher anonymity and, thus, crime10. Additionally, a recent empirical study from survey data65 agrees with our result, obtained instead with large-scale and passively collected information. In the supplementary materials (SI), we compare all the cities in detail"
"Homicide rates are spatially associated with built environment and socio-economic factors: a study in the neighbourhoods of Toronto, Canada",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9351166/,,"""Objectives Homicide rate is associated with a large variety of factors and therefore unevenly distributed over time and space. This study aims to explore homicide patterns and their spatial associations with different socioeconomic and built-environment conditions in 140 neighbourhoods of the city of Toronto, Canada. Methods A homicide dataset covering the years 2012 to 2021 and neighbourhood-based indicators were analysed using spatial techniques such as Kernel Density Estimation, Global/Local Moran’s I and Kulldorff’s SatScan spatio-temporal methodology. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multi-scale GWR (MGWR) were used to analyse the spatially varying correlations between the homicide rate and independent variables. The latter was particularly suitable for manifested spatial variations between explanatory variables and the homicide rate and it also identified spatial non-stationarities in this connection. Results The adjusted R2 of the MGWR was 0.53, representing a 4.35 and 3.74% increase from that in the linear regression and GWR models, respectively. Spatial and spatio-temporal high-risk areas were found to be significantly clustered in downtown and the north-western parts of the city. Some variables (e.g., the population density, material deprivation, the density of commercial establishments and the density of large buildings) were significantly associated with the homicide rate in different spatial ways. Conclusion The findings of this study showed that homicide rates were clustered over time and space in certain areas of the city. Socioeconomic and the built environment characteristics of some neighbourhoods were found to be associated with high homicide rates but these factors were different for each neighbourhood.""","In a first step, a literature search identified 25 indicators related to socioeconomic characteristics and the built environment (Table ​(Table1).1). Pearson’s correlation was used to identify associated variables with homicide rates at the neighbourhood scale; five (dependency ratio, subway stations, sport places, public parks and mobility status) of the 25 variables did not significantly associate with the homicide rate and were removed from the rest of analyses (Supplementary File 1). Then, the exploratory regression analysis was conducted to remove the variables that had collinearity with each other, resulting in removing four variables (ethnic concentration, parking lots, rate of adults lacking tertiary education and residential instability) of the 20 remained variables with VIF bigger than 7.5 (Supplementary File 2). The exploratory regression model was run again with the remaining 16 variables as input, with the best model based on six variables (unemployment rate, population density, material deprivation, sex ratio, commercial establishments and large buildings) selected for the OLS regression (Supplementary File 3). Four variables (population density, material deprivation, commercial establishments and large buildings) remained for the geographical regression analysis (Supplementary File 4). Figure ​Figure22 shows the complete, methodological framework used in this study. Model implementation was thus carried out with only four independent variables, leaving three datasets to spatially analyse and explore the association between homicide rates and neighbourhood characteristics as follows: The homicide dataset, containing 701 homicides recorded by Toronto Police Services (TPS) between 2012 and 2021, was extracted as geocoded points in a GIS shapefile [8]. It included the total number of homicides, killing locations, occurrence dates and type of homicide (shooting, stabbing etc.). These point data were aggregated to the neighbourhood polygon layer and used for analysis. The socio-economic characteristics (Table ​(Table1)1) of 140 Toronto neighbourhoods were derived from the Toronto City government open data portal [79] and Ontario Marginalization Index (ON-Marg) (http://www.ontariohealthprofiles.ca). The population for the last Census of the study period (2016) was used to calculate the homicide rate. Since the socio-economic and built environment factors of neighbourhoods were presumed to become associated with crimes in the long term, the 2016 Toronto Census data and neighbourhood profiles were used as basis for selecting the independent variables [79, 80]. The built-environment indicators (Table ​(Table1)1) were extracted from the Toronto City government portal. Due to the importance of determining an accurate location of different places and built-environment features for spatial analysis, we calculated the spatial density per/km2 (based on the number of dwellings in each building) in each of these places (Table ​(Table1).1). This indicator allowed us to more accurately identify the areas of the city where large buildings are located. Figure ​Figure33 presents the spatial distribution and values (low to high) of each of the variables analysed in this study. It should be noted that the excluded variables by Pearson’s correlation have not been included in this figure."
How the COVID-19 pandemic hit crime in Barcelona: Analysis of variation in crime trends,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10014451/,# Expand contractions in the 'tweet' column,"Objectives: To compare the observed and forecasted crime trends in Barcelona, using crime statistics from January 2018 to March 2021. Methods: We trained (seasonal) auto-regressive integrated moving average modelling (95% confidence intervals) using daily recorded crimes from January 2018 to February 2020. These models were then used to forecast crime data from March 2020 to March 2021 across four periods (lockdown, summer, fall and winter). Crime data were organized into two categories: property (burglary, theft) and violent crimes (robbery, assault, domestic violence and sexual offenses [rape, assault or abuse]). Results: Overall, crime levels for property and violent crimes during lockdown declined sharply from the forecasted levels. Theft, burglary, assault, robbery and sexual offenses exhibited general decreases throughout the study period, with the same sharp declines during the lockdown, progressive recovery in the summer, and steady or slight reductions from fall to March 2021. Only domestic violence differed, reaching the forecasted levels for all periods and surpassing the forecast for summer 2020. Conclusions: Our findings show how the pandemic has affected mid-term crime trends. They help to place the measures applied in the last year into context and to determine the most suitable policies to reduce crime during societal change.","This study analyses whether the trend of daily recorded crime by Catalonia's police force (Mossos d’Esquadra) in the city of Barcelona (1,664,182 inhabitants) changed due to the containment policies (during lockdown, i.e., March 15 to June 21 2020) and during the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic (post-lockdown; including summer, fall, and winter). The first data point for the current database was 1 January 2018, and the most recent addition was on 31 March 2021. These data, therefore, covered a year after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the WHO on 11 March 2020 and a period after the 3-month lockdown period from 15 March to 21 June 2020. We focused on daily offense records for 15 types of crimes (Table 2). The official data provided by the police included both consummated crime (e.g., killing a person with a knife) and attempted crime (e.g., sticking a knife in a vital area with an intention to kill, but where the victim survived). However, they do not include crimes committed through imprudence (e.g., if a flowerpot is thrown from a balcony and kills someone or if the facts do not show a clear intent to kill)."
Small area variation in crime effects of COVID-19 policies in England and Wales,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9753224/,df['tweet_expanded'] = df['tweet'].apply(lambda x: contractions.fix(x)),"Purpose The aim of this study is to examine small area variation in crime trajectories during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales. While we know how police-recorded crime responded to lockdown policies at the ‘macro’ level, less is known about the extent to which these trends were experienced uniformly at localized spatial scales. Methods Longitudinal k-means clustering is used to unpick local area variation in police notifiable offences across England and Wales. We describe the clusters identified in terms of their spatial patterning, opportunity structures and crime type profile. Results We find that in most small areas, crime remained fairly stable throughout the pandemic. Instead, a small number of meso-level areas contributed a disproportionately large amount to the macro-level trend. These were typically city centers with plentiful pre-pandemic crime opportunities, dominated by theft and shoplifting offences. Conclusion Findings offer support for opportunity theories of crime and for a mobility theory of crime during the pandemic. We explore potential implications for policy, theory and further research.","To examine localized instability in the lockdown crime drop, we make use of three data sources, namely, open police-recorded crime data, geographic boundaries from Ordnance Survey and the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and data sourced from the Open Street Map API. Each of these are now outlined in turn, followed by an outline of the methods deployed. Code to replicate the data downloads, handling, analyses and visualization reported here are openly available. To summarize the opportunity structure of local areas we required a nationwide dataset of theoretically relevant facilities and urban features which could be aggregated at the LSOA level. To this end, we obtained point-level data from the Application Programming Interface (API) for Open Street Map via the osmdata package (Padgham, Lovelace, Salmon, & Rudis, 2017) in R (R Core Team, 2020). Open Street Map is a crowdsourced geospatial database containing a vast array of features which can be used for explaining the temporal and spatial patterning of crime (Langton & Solymosi, 2020). Geographic features are identified by pairs of keys and values which can be used to computationally query the API for geospatial data. Based on existing research examining the opportunity structures of fine-grained spatial scales, we collated the coordinate locations of the following facilities: • Nightlife: pubs, nightclubs, restaurants. • Shops: convenience stores, malls, shoe shops, department stores, clothes shops, electrical shops, supermarkets, chemists, greengrocers. • Public transport: bus stops and railway stations. • Bicycle parking: bicycle parking lots. The point-level data on these features were aggregated to create counts for each facility by LSOA. For simplicity, and due to issues of data sparsity, we sum the counts for each facility according to their overarching description (i.e. nightlife, shops, public transport, bicycle parking). We expect that LSOA containing a high number of facility counts across each domain will have higher pre-pandemic levels of crime, due to the plentiful opportunities for crime, and in turn, steeper declines in crime following lockdown as a result of these opportunities suddenly becoming unavailable. We expect areas with low counts across these domains to have similarly low crime levels pre-lockdown, and thus will remain low and stable following lockdown commencement."
Declines in Crime and Teen Childbearing: Identifying Potential Explanations for Contemporaneous Trends,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5040460/,df.head(),"Objectives The previous 25 years have witnessed remarkable upheavals in the social landscape of the United States. Two of the most notable trends have been dramatic declines in levels of crime as well as teen childbearing. Much remains unknown about the underlying conditions that might be driving these changes. More importantly, we do not know if the same distal factors that are responsible for the drop in the crime rate are similarly implicated in falling rates of teen births. We examine four overarching potential explanations: fluctuations in economic opportunity, shifting population demographics, differences in state-level policies, and changes in expectations regarding health and mortality. Methods We combine state-specific data from existing secondary sources and model trajectories of violent crime, homicides, robberies, and teen fertility over a 20-year period from 1990 to 2010 using simultaneous fixed-effects regression models. Results We find that 4 of the 21 predictors examined - growth in the service sector of the labor market, increasing racial diversity especially among Hispanics, escalating levels of migration, and the expansion of family planning services to low-income women – offer the most convincing explanations for why rates of violent crime and teen births have been steadily decreasing over time. Moreover, we are able to account for almost a quarter of the joint declines in violent crime and teen births. Conclusions Our conclusions underscore the far reaching effects that aggregate level demographic conditions and policies are likely to have on important social trends that might, at first glance, seem unrelated. Furthermore, the effects of policy efforts designed to target outcomes in one area are likely to spill over into other domains.","Although total violent crime rates do not provide an exact comparison to age-specific birth rates since they include crimes committed by individuals over the age of 19, the decision to employ overall as opposed to age-specific crime rates was made, a priori, due to a number of important considerations. First and foremost, rates of violent and criminal activity are highest among individuals between the ages of 15–24 and individual criminal activity peaks during late adolescence and early adulthood (BJS 2014; Hirschi and Gottfredson 1983). This relationship has remained consistent over time, as changes in nationwide homicide rates are highly correlated with changes in the national age structure, with declines in violent crime following declines in the percentage of the population under the age of 24 (Fox and Piquero 2003). Furthermore, while age-specific homicide rates are available at the state-level, age-specific rates of robbery, aggravated assault, and forcible rape are more difficult to obtain and are much less reliable. Second, the fathers of children born to teen mothers are often older (in their early to mid 20s) than their romantic partners (Ilo et al. 1999; Klein 2005; Lindberg et al. 1997). Some studies estimate that approximately two-thirds of adolescent births occur to post-school aged fathers (Males and Chew 1996). Thus, it is likely that by comparing overall rates of violent crimes to teen births, we will be examining social phenomena that are occurring to similarly aged populations. Finally, since this is, to our knowledge, the first study to examine potential simultaneous explanations for recent declines in crime and teen childbearing, we did not want to unduly limit our outcomes to overly restrictive age-ranges (ie. 15–17 year-olds vs. 18–19 year-olds) or specific types of criminal activity (ie. homicides, robberies, or assaults). Instead, we leave these more fine-grained distinctions to future research efforts."
Changing levels of local crime and mental health: a natural experiment using self-reported and service use data in Scotland,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577093/,"Baranyi, G., Cherrie, M., Curtis, S. E., Dibben, C., & Pearce, J. (2020). Changing levels of local crime and mental health: a natural experiment using self-reported and service use data in Scotland. Journal of epidemiology and community health, 74(10), 806–814. https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-213837","Background This study contributes robust evidence on the association between mental health and local crime rates by showing how changing exposure to small area-level crime relates to self-reported and administrative data on mental health. Methods The study sample comprised 112 251 adults aged 16–60 years, drawn from the Scottish Longitudinal Study, a 5.3% representative sample of Scottish population followed across censuses. Outcomes were individual mental health indicators: self-reported mental illness from the 2011 Census and linked administrative data on antidepressants and antipsychotics prescribed through primary care providers in the National Health Service in 2010/2012. Crime rates at data zone level (500–1000 persons) were matched to the participants’ main place of residence, as defined by general practitioner patient registration duration during 2004/2006, 2007/2009 and 2010/12. Average neighbourhood crime exposure and change in area crime were computed. Covariate-adjusted logistic regressions were conducted, stratified by moving status. Results In addition to average crime exposure during follow-up, recent increases in crime (2007/2009–2010/2012) were associated with a higher risk of self-reported mental illness, among ‘stayers’ aged 16–30 years (OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.22), and among ‘movers’ aged 31–45 years (OR=1.07; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). Prescribed medications reinforced these findings; worsening crime rates were linked with antidepressant prescriptions among young stayers (OR=1.09; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.14) and with antipsychotic prescriptions among younger middle-aged movers (OR=1.11; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23). Conclusion Changing neighbourhood crime exposure is related to individual mental health, but associations differ by psychiatric conditions, age and moving status. Crime reduction and prevention, especially in communities with rising crime rates, may benefit public mental health.","Data were drawn from the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), a 5.3% nationally representative sample of the Scottish population. The SLS includes individuals selected on the basis of 20 semirandom birthdates and present in any of the 1991, 2001 and 2011 Censuses.22 For this study, a subsample of >126 000 was extracted, including individuals present at both the 2001 and 2011 Censuses and aged between 16 and 60 years in 2001. We applied age restrictions because psychopharmacological treatment among older adults may be less likely to be initiated by a mental disorder.16 23 Individuals were excluded if living in communal establishments (eg, nursing homes) in 2001 or 2011 (1.0%) or having missing values for the covariates (10.5%). Area-level indicators of crime were linked to SLS participants using residential localities and dates of their registration with a general practitioner (GP). Healthcare administrative data were linked to participants based on unique personal identifiers (figure 1). Neighbourhood crime The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) includes a domain on local crime and is available for 6505 Scottish data zones, each comprising approximately 500–1000 residents. The crime domain aggregates police recorded and geo-referenced crimes and offences (eg, assault, crimes of violence, domestic housebreaking, drug offences and vandalism) throughout the preceding financial year.27 The Scottish Government applies disclosure control in low-crime areas by suppressing exact crime counts. To approximate missing values, we first ordered data zones by their non-suppressed crime ranks, assigned 0 crime into the lowest ranked unit and used linear interpolation to estimate suppressed numbers. Finally, crime rates per 1000 persons were computed based on population estimates. SIMD 2006 (first release), 2009 and 2012 provided longitudinal information on crime with consistent data zone boundaries (see changes in crime levels for Glasgow City in figure 2)."

International journal of injury control and safety promotion, 25(4), 443–448. https://doi.org/10.1080/17457300.2018.1467461","Identifying geographic areas and time periods of increased violence is of considerable importance in prevention planning. This study compared the performance of multiple data sources to prospectively forecast areas of increased interpersonal violence. We used 2011–2014 data from a large metropolitan county on interpersonal violence (homicide, assault, rape and robbery) and forecasted violence at the level of census block-groups and over a one-month moving time window. Inputs to a Random Forest model included historical crime records from the police department, demographic data from the US Census Bureau, and administrative data on licensed businesses. Among 279 block groups, a model utilizing all data sources was found to prospectively improve the identification of the top 5% most violent block-group months (positive predictive value = 52.1%; negative predictive value = 97.5%; sensitivity = 43.4%; specificity = 98.2%). Predictive modelling with simple inputs can help communities more efficiently focus violence prevention resources geographically.","To predict the future occurrence of violence at the block group level we assembled three main classes of potential predictors to test their relative contributions to the model: (1) historical crime data, (2) neighbourhood demographic characteristics and (3) local business information. First, for historical crime information, we created monthly lagged variables going back 24 months for each block group that includes the total number of violent crimes. We also created 24 months of lagged variables for property crimes (burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft) to use as a predictor in our model. In addition to lags at the specified number of months, lagged variables were created that included the cumulative number of violence- and property-related crimes at each time point. All crime predictors were continuous variables. Second, to assemble block group demographic variables, the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) was used (United States Census Bureau. American Community Survey (ACS), 2016). The ACS includes the most detailed measures of citizen demographics available; however, results for such variables are present as five-year averages (2010– 2014) due to the need to produce stable estimates within small geographic areas. Thus, the demographic variables included help to inform the baseline, chronic level of violence risk and could contribute to short-term violence risk through their interactions with other variables; however, the values of such predictors are stable through the study period. For this study, the 20 ACS variables with the highest correlation coefficient with the number of violent crimes in a block group were selected for further exploration. Third, predictor variables were created which specified the presence of various business types within each block group by year. These data were obtained from a commercial data provider, referenceUSA, a commonly used source for business and residential information (Grimm, Moore, & Scanlon, 2013). Seven business types were incorporated into the data-set, including liquor stores, bars, gas stations, check cashing stores, escort services, massage parlours and pawn shops. Business types were chosen based on prior associations in the literature (Scribner et al., 1995) as well as unpublished local investigations."

SSM - population health, 10, 100546. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100546","The importance of social isolation and loneliness on our health is widely recognised in previous research. This study compares loneliness in deprived neighbourhood with that in the general population. It further examines whether social isolation and loneliness are associated with health-risk behaviours (including low intake of fruit or vegetables, daily smoking, high-risk alcohol intake, and physical inactivity and their co-occurrence) in deprived neighbourhoods, and whether social isolation and loneliness modify the associations between socioeconomic status and health-risk behaviours. Cross-sectional data from 5113 residents of 12 deprived neighbourhoods in Denmark were analysed using multiple logistic regression. Data on 14,686 individuals from the nationally representative Danish Health and Morbidity Survey 2010 were used as a comparison group with regard to loneliness. Cohabitation status, frequency of meeting with family and friends, participation in voluntary work were used as an indicator to measure social isolation. A question on feeling often unwillingly alone was used as an indicator to measure loneliness. Compared with the general population, residents of deprived neighbourhoods had higher odds of loneliness. Both social isolation and loneliness were significantly associated with higher odds of health-risk behaviour. When social isolation and loneliness were combined with low socioeconomic status, strong associations with health-risk behaviours were found. Social isolation and loneliness did not significantly modify the associations between socioeconomic status and health-risk behaviour. The findings in this study have important implications for the future planning of health promotion intervention programmes aimed to reduce health-risk behaviour in deprived neighbourhoods.",
"Exploring Spatial Associations between On-Sale Alcohol Availability, Neighborhood Population Characteristics, and Violent Crime in a Geographically Isolated City",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24804143/,"Han, D., & Gorman, D. M. (2013). Exploring Spatial Associations between On-Sale Alcohol Availability, Neighborhood Population Characteristics, and Violent Crime in a Geographically Isolated City. Journal of addiction, 2013, 356152. https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/356152","Objectives. Despite the increasing evidence of the associations between alcohol availability and violence, there are still inconsistent findings on the effects of on- and off-sale alcohol outlets on violent crime. The aim of this study was to examine spatial associations between on-sale alcohol availability, neighborhood characteristics, and violent crime in a geographically isolated city in Texas. Methods. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and global regression models were employed to analyze the nature of the spatial relationship between violent crime, neighborhood sociocultural characteristics, and on-sale alcohol environment. Results. We found strong effects of neighborhood characteristics combined with on-sale alcohol availability on violence outcomes. Several neighborhood variables combined with alcohol availability explained about 63% of the variability in violence. An additional 7% was explained by the GWR model, while spatially nonstationary associations between violence and some predictor variables were observed. Conclusions. This study provided more credible evidence of the influence of on-sale alcohol outlets on violence in a unique setting. These findings have important policy implications in addressing the question of public health consequences of alcohol-related violence in local contexts.","2.1. Study Population and Data As noted above, the city of Lubbock provides a fairly unique setting to investigate the relationship between on-sale alcohol availability and violence, because of its geographically isolated location and (prior to August, 2009) its retail alcohol market being comprised almost exclusively of on-premise outlets (only a handful of off-sale outlets existed in an area south of the city known as “The Strip”). The estimated population of the city for 2009 was 226,000, making it the 11th largest city in the state of Texas. The city is also home to Texas Technical University which had a student population of 30,049 in the fall semester of 2009. The closest population center to the north of Lubbock is Amarillo, which is 124 miles away and about a two-hour journey by car. The nearest cities after this (Oklahoma city, Fort Worth, Albuquerque, and Las Cruces) are each 300 to 400 miles away. In addition, the eight counties that surround Lubbock have low population density and three are totally “dry” (i.e., the sale of alcohol beverage is illegal). None of the remaining five is totally “wet”: about half of the precincts in four of these countries are dry, and the one county that has no dry precincts allows only off-premise sales of beer and wine. As part of a larger study designed to examine the effects of the introduction of off-sale licenses in the city on September 23, 2009 [10], the present analysis focuses on the association between on-sale alcohol outlet density and violent crime prior to the introduction of off-sale outlets, hence the discontinuation of the dataset in August, 2009. Three archival data sets were employed in the study. First, data pertaining to reports of violent crime (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) during the time period January, 2005 and August, 2009 were obtained directly from the city of Lubbock Police Department. The dataset contained the date, time, and street address for each violent crime incident. There were a total of 7327 violent crimes for the 56-month time period, of which 49 (0.7%) were murders, 374 (5.1%) rapes, 1422 (19.4%) robberies, and 5482 (74.8%) assaults. Close to 99% of these violent crimes were geocoded by street address using Centrus Desktop. These data were then aggregated to the census block group level and the violent crime rate was calculated as crimes per 1,000 persons. Second, a list of all alcohol outlets active during the same 56-month time period in the city of Lubbock was obtained from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (ABC) online database, which includes the name, geographic location, and type of permit or license of the outlet. There were a total of 197 on-sale licenses over the study time period, and outlet density per 1000 residents was used as a measure of alcohol availability. All outlets were geocoded and aggregated to the census block group level in the analysis. Third, neighborhood population and sociostructural variables were extracted from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey 5-year estimate [11]. Consistent with previous ecological studies of alcohol availability and violence [3, 4], 12 neighborhood sociostructural variables were used as potential covariates in the analysis. These 12 neighborhood sociostructural variables fell into three major categories: (1) concentrated disadvantage: % families below poverty, % households receiving public assistance, % unemployed over age 16, % female-headed households with children, % Black, and % Hispanic; (2) residential instability: % of residents over age 1 who have lived in the same house 1 year ago, % homes that are owner occupied, % vacant housing units; (3) sociodemographic measures of the resident population: adult to child ratio, population density, and % population that is male and aged 15–24. 2.2. Statistical Analyses Multivariate regression analysis was first conducted to examine the relationship between alcohol outlet densities, neighborhood sociostructural characteristics, and violent crime rate. Specifically, a stepwise ordinary least square (OLS) procedure was run to identify significant explanatory variables, with a 0.01 significance level for entry and a 0.05 level for removal. The candidate covariates in the study were the 12 factors pertaining to neighborhood characteristics described previously. Before performing the regression analysis, percent Black and outlet density variables were log transformed to adjust for skew. The dependent variable (violent crime per 1,000 population) was also log transformed, and a small constant was added to transform zero values. Plots of leverage values were used to identify outlying extreme values, and the variance inflation factors (VIF) were obtained for each of the explanatory variables to assess multicollinearity. Residual plots and partial regression plots were also checked for nonrandom pattern and model specification to ensure the inclusion of all the important explanatory variables in the final model. Regressions were also run with mean replacement for a small number of missing neighborhood variables, but results essentially remained unchanged and therefore are not reported. To explore spatial association in the relationships between alcohol outlet densities, neighborhood sociostructural characteristics and the violent crime rate across the study area, the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) method was also employed [12]. The GWR produces a separate parameter estimate of regression coefficients, goodness-of-fit, and significance assessment for each observation. To minimize potential problems associated with multiple testing and multicollinearity among predictor variables, those statistically valid and significant predictors identified using OLS procedures were used in GWR model. For GWR modeling, we used adaptive kernels based on bisquare weighting function due to the irregular shape of the study area [13]. This method is often preferred in identifying the optimal number of nearest neighbors, considering the density and size of samples. To identify the optimal size of kernels, we used the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) optimization method which identifies the bandwidth that minimizes the AIC score and that accounts for the local variation in the size of the data set [12, 14]. Estimates of spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) were also obtained to ensure that residuals were not spatially correlated. Monte-Carlo significance tests were conducted to assess statistical significance of nonstationarity for alcohol availability and each of the covariates [15]. The calibration of local GWR models was performed using the GWR 3.0 [12]."

A., Lane, S., Jennings-Bey, T., Haygood-El, A., Brundage, K., & Rubinstein, R. A. (2017). Spatio-temporal patterns of gun violence in Syracuse, New York 2009-2015. PloS one, 12(3), e0173001. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173001","Gun violence in the United States of America is a large public health problem that disproportionately affects urban areas. The epidemiology of gun violence reflects various aspects of an infectious disease including spatial and temporal clustering. We examined the spatial and temporal trends of gun violence in Syracuse, New York, a city of 145,000. We used a spatial scan statistic to reveal spatio-temporal clusters of gunshots investigated and corroborated by Syracuse City Police Department for the years 2009-2015. We also examined predictors of areas with increased gun violence using a multi-level zero-inflated Poisson regression with data from the 2010 census. Two space-time clusters of gun violence were revealed in the city. Higher rates of segregation, poverty and the summer months were all associated with increased risk of gun violence. Previous gunshots in the area were associated with a 26.8% increase in the risk of gun violence. Gun violence in Syracuse, NY is both spatially and temporally stable, with some neighborhoods of the city greatly afflicted.","Study location The city of Syracuse lies in central New York (43.0469° N, 76.1444° W), and is the fourth largest city in the state of New York. According to the 2010 census the city had a population of 145,170, with an estimated 732,117 people in the greater metropolitan area. The median income for the city of Syracuse is $31,365, with 34.6% of the city’s residents below the federal poverty line. Forty-seven percent of the population is non-White and not Hispanic according to the 2010 census. Syracuse had the highest concentration of poverty among African Americans and Hispanics in the US [24]. Data We retrieved incidents of shots fired between the dates of January 2009 and July 2015, inclusive, from the Syracuse City police department crime database. The database contains the following information on each incident of shots fired that has been validated by investigation: date, time, address, type of crime, e.g., whether the shots were related to a burglary or assault, other crime, and the number of people killed. We retrieved census block group information including geographic shape files from the 2010 United States Census. Open Street Maps provided a backdrop for visualization of the gunshots [25]. Spatio-temporal analysis We converted the address of each gunshot incident to geo-coordinates using the MMQGIS plug-in for Quantum GIS version 2.0. We then generated 4 random control locations within the city boundaries of Syracuse for each episode of gun violence and conducted the spatial scan statistic of gunshots utilizing a Bernoulli process with month as the time period of analysis. The spatial scan statistic, developed by Martin Kulldorff [26], estimates clustering of phenomena within geographical and temporal bounds. In brief the spatial scan statistic creates a moving window wherein the intensity of the gunshots is calculated inside the window and compared to the intensity of the gunshots calculated outside the window. The window with the greatest differential in the intensity of gunshots is considered the primary cluster. Secondary clusters can also be examined. When including a temporal axis the moving window can be thought of as a cylinder that examines intensity within both space and time within the window compared to outside the window. The spatial scan statistic has been used to examine clusters of violence in Newark, NJ as well as São Paulo, Brazil [11,27]. We used the SatScan software version 9.3 to calculate the spatial scan statistic for gunshots within the city of Syracuse [28]. The use of the Bernoulli process avoided a small numbers problem that would have been introduced by using a Poisson process of gun violence rates of census block groups. Factors predicting gunshot violence at the census block-group level We retrieved census data from the 2010 US census for the city of Syracuse. There were 53 census tracts in Syracuse, divided into 151 census block groups for which demographic data is available. We then conducted a zero-inflated Poisson regression of the number of gunshots per month per census block group with correlated standard errors at the census block group level. A zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is a two-stage process, first predicting whether there were any gunshots in a census block group or not and then predicting among those with gunshots the number of gunshots in a Poisson distribution. From the available measures in the US census at census block-group level we hypothesized that the following would be associated with gunshots in the census block group: percent of renting households, ratio of empty (vacant) households to occupied households, ratio of female population to male population, and percent of households that identify as either African-American or Hispanic. In the inflation process of the ZIP model we categorized these factors as above or below the median to predict whether there would be any gunshots in a particular census-block-group month. We then incorporated these factors as continuous variables in the Poisson process of the ZIP model. We also controlled for year, whether the month fell between May and October, and the number of gunshots in the census block-group the previous month. The equations for the ZIP model are presented below wherein yij is the number of gunshots per census block group (i) during month (j), π is the probability of a census block group having zero shots that month, λ is the Poisson distribution, β represents the covariates included in the analysis as specified above, and hij is the count of gunshots in a given census block group (i) during month (j). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine if the modifiable areal unit problem might be biasing the results from the ZIP model. Gun violence as we have described it herein typically occurs outside rather than in homes, and so aggregating household census data into census block groups better captures neighborhood effects than household census data. To determine if the arbitrary delineation of census block groups affected the results we jittered the location of the each incident of gun violence by a random factor between -462m and 462m on both the x and y axes. We then reran the ZIP analysis and compared the direction, magnitude and significance of results. We used Stata version 13.1 for the regression analysis."
Neighborhood Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence: A Theory-Informed Analysis Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28913863/,"Voith, L. A., & Brondino, M. J. (2017). Neighborhood Predictors of Intimate Partner Violence: A Theory-Informed Analysis Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. American journal of community psychology, 60(1-2), 187–198. https://doi.org/10.1002/ajcp.12163","Due to high prevalence rates and deleterious effects on individuals, families, and communities, intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem. Because IPV occurs in the context of communities and neighborhoods, research must examine the broader environment in addition to individual-level factors to successfully facilitate behavior change. Drawing from the Social Determinants of Health framework and Social Disorganization Theory, neighborhood predictors of IPV were tested using hierarchical linear modeling. Results indicated that concentrated disadvantage and female-to-male partner violence were robust predictors of women's IPV victimization. Implications for theory, practice, and policy, and future research are discussed.","""Participants and Data The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study dataset (McLanahan, 1998; Reichman, Teitler, Garfinkel, & McLanahan, 2001) is comprised of a cohort of nearly 5,000 children born in 16 U.S. metropolizes. In this study, approximately two-thirds of the families were at risk of breaking up and living in poverty (“fragile families”) compared to “traditional families” (Reichman et al., 2001). An in-person interview was conducted at the hospital after birth (baseline) and four following waves of data were conducted via phone interviews with mothers and fathers when the child was 1, 3, 5, and 9 years old. The dataset includes core study questions surveyed at each wave and ancillary study questions surveyed at various waves. Although IPV was assessed at each time point, neighborhood variables of interest were only collected during wave 4, i.e., when the child was 5 years old. As a result, the current study analyzed data in wave 4. As can be seen in Fig. 1, of the total sample (N = 4,898), n = 759 participants were not in the wave. This attrition rate (16%) meets acceptable standards of large-scale survey studies (Kristman, Manno, & Côté, 2004). A number of wave four participants, n = 2,177, responded that they were not currently in a romantic relationship with the father of their child and, subsequently, were not included in the primary analyses. However, of this subsample, 843 mothers reported that they were previously involved in a romantic relationship with the father of their child and reported on IPV in the last month of their relationship; robustness checks were completed on this subsample. Women involved in a romantic partnership with someone other than the father of her child (n = 1,071) were excluded from the analysis because follow-up surveys were not conducted with these partners. After identifying the subsample of mother's reporting on IPV in current relationships with the father of the child, data from the fathers were matched and census tract data was applied. Only census tracts that included more than one participant (range 2–8) were included in the final analysis. The final sample included n = 474 individuals across n = 186 census tracts. Outcome Variable Lindhorst and Tajima (2008) conceptualized IPV as a “pattern of behaviors that yields adverse effects perceived by the victim (e.g., injury, harm, fear, intimidation) and that is motivated by the perpetrator's need for power” (p. 364). Thus, IPV was conceptualized to incorporate the multi-dimensional nature of partner violence, including psychological aggression, and physical or sexual violence. Six indicators operationalized psychological aggression (e.g., father “keeps me from seeing or talking to friends or family,” “prevents me from going to work or school”) (α = .671). Five items operationalized physical or sexual violence (e.g., the father of your child “hits you with a fist or object that could hurt,” “slaps or kicks you,” “forces unwanted sex”) (α = .783). Each item assessed how often the behavior occurred (i.e., never, sometimes, often), with no specific time frame appended to the question. Some items are drawn from the Conflict Tactic Scale, a well-validated and widely used scale in research (Straus, 1979) and other items are drawn from Lloyd's (1997) interviews with domestic violence victims. Social environment The Social Determinants of Health framework conceptualizes the social environment using elements of stressful living conditions (e.g., gangs) (Solar & Irwin, 2010). In this study, father's perception of community-based violence was measured using a single item, “Have you ever been afraid to let your child go outside because of violence in your community?” with a dichotomous response scale. Computed as a proportion and averaged within census tracts to aggregate the level of perceived community violence within a census tract, this variable ranged from 0 (no perception of violence) to 1 (perception of violence). Social disorganization Drawing from Sampson et al. (1997) theory of social disorganization, concentrated disadvantage, immigrant population, and residential instability were constructed from 2000 U.S. Census data, corresponding with the time of data collection. First, a parallel analysis (Watkins, 2000) was conducted which suggested a two-factor solution. This was followed up with an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (Kaiser, 1960), which resulted in two factors. The data were examined using the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy and the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity, both of which indicated acceptable standards for a factor analysis. Next, examination of the eigenvalues above 1.0 and the scree plot indicated a two-factor solution. The rotation was determined using the component correlation matrix. Results indicated a weak, and thus uncorrelated, relationship between the two factors. The first factor, concentrated disadvantage, loaded on five indicators: % families below poverty level in 1999; % households on public assistance; % civilian labor force (16+) unemployed; % family households with kids below age 18 headed by females; and the % population non-Hispanic Black in a census-tract. The second factor, Immigrant population, loaded on two indicators: % population Hispanic and % foreign born in a census-tract. Factor correlation indicated that there was less than a 10% overlap of variance among factors and, thus, a Varimax rotation was applied (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Regression based factor scores for both constructs were created using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Released 2013, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY, USA). Finally, residential instability was operationalized using a single indicator, % renter-occupied housing units in a census-tract, and modeled as a continuous variable. Typically, this variable includes the duration of residency, i.e., living in the same home for 5 years or more (Sampson et al., 1997); however, this information was not available. Nevertheless, renter-occupied compared to owner-occupied units represent more transient tenets, i.e., residential instability. Social capital Social capital has been conceptualized as a psychosocial process (i.e., the relationships that exist between neighbors or social support) and the material resources that contribute to or deprivation that detracts from a community (Hunter, Neiger, & West, 2011). Two items indicated social capital: social network density and community based participation. Social network density was measured using one item, “How many of the families on your block would you say that you know well?” Averaged within each census tract, responses ranging from 1 to 5, were coded to have lower scores reflect loose social networks and higher scores reflect dense social networks. Men's level of participation in community based organizations was operationalized using the item “Do you participate in any groups, such as senior centers, social groups, work groups, church, charity, service, or community groups?” Responses to this item were averaged within each census tract. The variable ranged from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating high community based participation and 0 indicating low community based participation. Collective efficacy Collective efficacy is the “ability of communities to effectively mobilize to regulate local crime” (Browning, 2002). To construct this variable, a parallel analysis (Watkins, 2000) was conducted, which suggested a two-factor solution, followed by an EFA (Thompson, 2004). Results from the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy and the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity indicated acceptable standards for a factor analysis. Next, eigenvalues above 1.0 and the scree plot suggested a two-factor solution, mirroring theory and previous research (Sampson et al., 1997), i.e., social cohesion and informal social control. Scores were summed for each factor and averaged across census tracts. Respondents were asked to what extent they agree or disagree with five statements regarding social cohesion (e.g., “people around here are willing to help their neighbors”) (α = .754). Informal social control was measured using five items, asking respondents how likely neighbors were to intervene if they witnessed undesirable behavior (e.g., “children skipping school and hanging out on street corners”) (α = .860). Response scales were coded with low numbers reflecting low levels and high numbers reflecting high levels of social cohesion and informal social control. Level-1 Variables Focusing on men-as-perpetrators, each individual-level variable included in the analysis was based on fathers’ characteristics. That is, all level-1, or individual-level, variables were based on father-report. Previous research indicating risk factors for men's use of IPV guided the inclusion of each factor (e.g., Stith et al., 2004). Alcohol use Alcohol use was conceptualized using the consumption and frequency of binge drinking. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration Alcohol Use Disorder guidelines (SAMHSA, 2015) were used to model drinking behavior closest to “moderate,” “binge,” and “heavy drinkers” standards. Based on participant responses, Abstainers/ Moderate drinkers included individuals who reported 0 drinks in the past year or occasions in which they consumed 1–3 drinks in the past year. Individuals who refused to answer (n = 3) were coded as Abstainers/Moderate drinkers, resulting in a conservative estimate. Binge drinkers included individuals who reported consuming four or more drinks less than once a month or about one time per month in the past year. Heavy drinkers included individuals who reported consuming four or more drinks a few times a month, every week, or every day in the past year. Drug use Illicit drug use was captured using 10 items inquiring if men had used illicit substances (e.g., crack/cocaine, heroin, marijuana) in the past 12 months. Because the number of men endorsing drug use was so small (n = 68), the categories of drug use were collapsed into a dichotomous variable. Endorsement of any drug use was coded 1, else 0. Impulsivity Father's level of impulsivity was measured using six items from the Dickman scale (1990) of dysfunctional impulsivity (α = .842). Collected in wave 2, items such as “Often, I don't think before I act” were measured on a scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Scale items were summed for each case; low numbers indicated low levels of dysfunctional impulsivity and high numbers indicated high levels of dysfunctional impulsivity. Female-to-male IPV (FMPV) The same items used to conceptualize women's report of IPV victimization, were used for father report of IPV victimization. However, the items were worded “how often does the mother of your child…” with a scale of frequency, i.e., 1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often. T-scores were calculated after creating a composite of each scale, transforming each composite into z-scores, and finally the z-scores were multiplied by a standard deviation of 10 and a mean of 50 was added. Summing the t-scores, psychological aggression (α = .691) and physical or sexual violence (α = .732), and dividing by the total types (2), the variable Female-to-Male Partner IPV was created. Covariates To construct father's self-reported level of education, data from waves 1–4 were used to ascertain men's current level of education at wave 4. The response items were coded as 1 = less than high school, 2 = high school or GED, 3 = some college or technical schooling, and 4 = college graduate. Father's employment status was dichotomized using father's report of any legitimate, i.e., legal, work in the past week. Endorsement of this item was coded 1, else 0. Father's age was based on self-report and modeled as a continuous variable. The items were coded such that low numbers reflected less violence exposure and high numbers indicted more violence exposure. Due to the varying items per scale, the total scores were standardized using t-scores for each type of violence exposure, i.e., psychological aggression (M = 49.65, SD = 9.52, range: 44.11–116.18), and physical or sexual violence (M = 49.84, SD = 10.21, range: 48.14–181.32). Summing each t-score and dividing by the total subtype (2), the variable Total IPV was created. Level-Two Variables The items were coded such that low numbers reflected less violence exposure and high numbers indicted more violence exposure. Due to the varying items per scale, the total scores were standardized using t-scores for each type of violence exposure, i.e., psychological aggression (M = 49.65, SD = 9.52, range: 44.11–116.18), and physical or sexual violence (M = 49.84, SD = 10.21, range: 48.14–181.32). Summing each t-score and dividing by the total subtype (2), the variable Total IPV was created."""

This study examines school characteristics that increase the odds of nonfatal teacher assaults and the influence of community crime on these relationships. Methods: Assaults from California Employers' Reports of Occupational Injury or Illness were linked to California Department of Education data for Los Angeles City public schools. Community crime rates were calculated from Los Angeles Police Department data. Random-intercept logistic models were used to examine associations between school characteristics and teacher assault injury across community crime levels. Results: Teacher assault was associated with teaching staff's total years of educational service, gender, and education level. Community crime surrounding the schools influenced the relationships between teacher assault injury and school, student and teacher characteristics. Conclusions: School-based programs to reduce violence on school grounds may be more effective in collaboration with programs to prevent community crime.",

The Journal of school health, 78(10), 539–571. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1746-1561.2008.00341.x","Abstract Background: While crime and violence in schools are derived primarily from factors external to schools, violent behavior may also be aggravated by factors in the school environment, including the physical environment, its educational and social climate, and its organizational capacity and composition. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of the school's organizational and educational environment on crime rates in secondary schools and to examine how neighborhood factors influence these relationships. Methods: School and neighborhood crime rates for 95 middle (MS) and high (HS) schools were calculated using data from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Police Department and Los Angeles Police Department, respectively. School-level organizational and educational variables, including the academic performance index (API), were obtained from the California Department of Education. A measure of neighborhood dilapidation was created using variables collected on a neighborhood environmental survey. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between organizational and educational school variables and school crime rates. Community crime and dilapidation were added to the model to examine the influence of the school-community context relationships. Results: HS had higher crime rates than MS. As the percentage of certified teachers and student to staff ratios increased, school crime decreased (p < .01). An API of below basic performance was significantly associated with increasing school crime rates (p < .05). Neighborhood crime was not significantly associated with school crime, although dilapidation was positively and significantly associated with school crime even after controlling for community crime (p < .05). Conclusions: Both school- and neighborhood-level factors were associated with increasing crime rates in secondary schools. School violence prevention efforts should include school and community partnerships to address these potentially modifiable factors.","Study Population Middle schools and high schools within the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in Los Angeles City were eligible for study participation. LAUSD schools were identified from a list of schools updated annually by the California Department of Education (CDE) and available publicly on the CDE Web site. The 2000-2001 school-year listing of LAUSD middle and high schools was downloaded from the CDE Web site and included 54 middle schools and 41 high schools located within Los Angeles City geographic parameters. These 95 schools comprised the study population. LAUSD was selected because it is the second largest school district in the United States, enrolling more than 700,000 students each year. Schools within Los Angeles City were selected due to the availability of published crime data through the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), which is the law enforcement entity overseeing the city limits. Data Collection School crime rate was the dependent variable of interest. Incidents of school crime for the 2000-2001 school-year were downloaded from the LAUSD Police Department Web site and included assaults, batteries, homicides, robberies, weapons possession, substance abuse, and sex offenses. The school crime rate was calculated as the total number of school crimes per 1000 students enrolled during the 2000-2001 academic school year. School-level organizational and educational variables for the 2000-2001 school year were downloaded from the CDE Web site and included suspension/expulsion rates (number of expulsions/suspensions per student enrollment per 100 students), percentage of certified teachers, student to teacher ratio (total number of enrolled students per total number of teachers), student enrollment, academic performance index, and percentage of students on free or reduced lunch programs. These variables were selected based on applicability within school organizational and educational constructs and their availability in the CDE databases. All variables remained continuous for analysis, rescaled to reflect more meaningful unit changes, with the exception of the academic performance index (API), which was categorized into 2 performance levels. API levels are defined by the CDE, in compliance with the California Public Schools Accountability Act of 1999, to measure academic performance and growth over time. Each school must strive to meet a target API score of 800 (on a scale from 200 to 1000) as specified by the California State Board of Education (SBE). Since the API scores in the study population of 95 middle and high schools ranged from 385 to 766, the cut point for dichotomization could not be 800. Rather, 500 was selected, which represents the SBE classification for schools measuring “below basic” academically. School-level variables representing the context of the community environment included community crime rates and a measure of neighborhood dilapidation, referred to as the dilapidation index (DI). Community crime data were abstracted from LAPD records for each reporting district containing a school in the study population. Community crime included incidents of assault, homicide, robbery, and sex offenses. The community crime rate was calculated as the total number of community crimes per LAPD reporting district acreage per 2000-2001 academic year. Acreage was used in the denominator to control for the variance in reporting district sizes. The DI comprises of the following 6 variables measuring the physical condition of the neighborhood block surrounding each school: visible graffiti, painted over graffiti, litter, cleanliness, dilapidated buildings, and dilapidated streets and sidewalks. Each variable of the index was scored using a 4-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (least level of disorder) to 4 (highest level of disorder). The scores were summed across the 6 variables to create the DI (possible range = 4–24) (Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient = 0.96). DI variables were collected on a neighborhood factors survey developed to operationalize social disorder within the context of the Broken Windows theory.3 The survey was completed on-site by school security professionals licensed through the American Society of Industrial Security. Analysis All CDE data were linked by the school identification number used uniformly across all CDE databases. These data were linked by school address to school crime frequencies available from the LAUSD Police Department, and these data were geocoded by school address against LAPD maps to obtain the corresponding reporting district for calculating community crime rates. Descriptive statistics (medians and ranges) were calculated for school organizational and educational factors and for the community context variables, by school level (middle, high) and for school levels combined. Wilcoxon scores compared distributions of the organizational and educational school variables between middle schools and high schools. Linear regression was used to independently estimate the relationships between organizational and educational school variables and school crime rates. Community crime and dilapidation were added to the linear models to examine the influence of the community context on these relationships. All analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)."
Neighborhood socioeconomic status is associated with violent reinjury,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25986212/,"Chong, V. E., Lee, W. S., & Victorino, G. P. (2015). Neighborhood socioeconomic status is associated with violent reinjury. The Journal of surgical research, 199(1), 177–182. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2015.03.086","Abstract Background: Measures of individual socioeconomic status correlate with recurrent violent injury; however, neighborhood socioeconomic status may also matter. We conducted a review of victims of interpersonal violence treated at our trauma center, hypothesizing that the percent of the population living under the poverty level in their neighborhood is associated with recurrent violent victimization. Materials and methods: We identified victims of interpersonal violence, ages 12-24, in our trauma registry from 2005-2010. Recurrent episodes of violent injury were identified through 2012. The percentage of the population living under the poverty level for the patient's zip code of residence was derived from United States census estimates and divided into quartiles. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to evaluate predictors of violent injury recidivism. Results: Our cohort consisted of 1890 patients. Multivariable logistic regression confirmed the following factors as independent predictors of violent injury recidivism: male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2 [1.06-3.80]; P = 0.03), black race (OR = 2.1 [1.44-3.06]; P < 0.001), injury due to firearms (OR = 1.67 [1.12-2.50]; P = 0.01), and living in the lowest zip code socioeconomic quartile (OR = 1.59 [1.12-2.25]; P = 0.01). Conclusions: For young patients injured by violence, the socioeconomic position of their neighborhood of residence is independently correlated with their risk of violent reinjury. Low neighborhood socioeconomic status may be associated with a disrupted sense of safety after injury and also may alter a person's likelihood of engaging in behaviors correlated with recurrent violent injury. Programs aimed at reducing violent injury recidivism should address needs at the individual and neighborhood level. Keywords: Interpersonal violence; Recidivism; Recurrent violent injury; Socioeconomic status; Trauma.","2. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from our trauma center registry. Our cohort consisted of patients treated at our hospital from January 1, 2005–December 31, 2010 for injuries due to interpersonal violence. This designation included persons who were assaulted with blunt objects, stabbed, and shot with a firearm but excluded those injured by self-harm and interventions by law enforcement. We included patients aged 12–24 y at the time of initial contact, which is the age of eligibility for our hospital-affiliated violence intervention program. We focus on this age group as we potentially have resources through our violence prevention program to further address their psychosocial needs. Patients who died as a result of their injuries were excluded from analysis, as inhospital mortality precludes study participants from potentially reaching our primary outcome of recurrent violent injury. Independent variables of interest were collected from our trauma registry and included patient demographic information (age, sex, race, zip code of residence, and insurance status), as well as clinical characteristics of their hospital encounter (mechanism of injury, injury severity score, disposition after initial trauma resuscitation, and length of stay in the hospital and/or intensive care unit). We used the percent of the population living below the federal poverty level as our area-based measure of socioeconomic position, and this was derived from techniques described in previously published articles highlighting the importance of neighborhood-level measures of socioeconomic status on health outcomes [14], [15]. We compiled a list of zip codes of residence for all patients in our trauma registry and divided them into quartiles based on the percent of the population living below the federal poverty level, which we obtained from the United States census [16]. This resulted in four area-based socioeconomic categories as follows: low (19%–40% of the population living below the federal poverty level), low-middle (12%–19% of the population living below the federal poverty level), high-middle (7%–12% of the population living below the federal poverty level), and high (2%–7% of the population living below the federal poverty level). We then cross-referenced our trauma registry data with these socioeconomic categories, placing individuals into the above quartiles by zip code of residence. The primary outcome for this study was recurrent violent injury requiring trauma center care. All persons in our cohort were followed until December 31st, 2012 in our trauma registry, and any further episodes of violent injury after the index case were identified. Patients who had recurrent episodes of violent injury were compared with patients who experienced no further interpersonal violence requiring trauma center care using the chi-square test to compare categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare continuous variables. We also stratified cohort characteristics by neighborhood socioeconomic quartile, comparing groups using the Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Categorical variables are reported as n (%), and continuous variables are reported as median (interquartile range). To examine the relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic position and risk of recurrent violent injury, we conducted logistic regression analysis. Unadjusted odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all variables of interest in relation to our primary outcome. Regression models were then developed to test the independent contribution of each variable, and we initially included all variables that were statistically significant in unadjusted analyses (P < 0.1) or were considered clinically important based on a priori hypotheses. Backward stepwise regression resulted in a final model consisting of variables reaching statistical significance. All statistical analysis was done with STATA/SE 12 software (College Station, TX). To account for variation in where our patients lived between injury episodes, we then conducted a sensitivity analysis for the zip codes of residence. In our registry, zip codes of residence are collected from patients at the time of injury. For some patients, this zip code may change between the time of the index injury to that of the recurrent injury, although we are not able to capture at what interval during this period this change in residence occurs. As such, we reviewed the instances in which a patient changed zip codes between injury episodes and conducted logistic regression analyses using zip codes of residence at both the time of index injury and the time of recurrent injury."
Social determinants and their interference in homicide rates in a city in northeastern Brazil,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25409648/,"de Sousa, G.dosS., Magalhães, F. B., Gama, I.daS., de Lima, M.

Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology, 17 Suppl 2, 194–203. https://doi.org/10.1590/1809-4503201400060016","Objective: This paper aims to analyze the possible relationship between social determinants and homicide mortality in Fortaleza (CE), Brazil. Method: To investigate whether the rate of mortality by homicides is related to social determinants, an ecological study with emphasis on spatial analysis was conducted in the city of Fortaleza. Social, economic, demographic and sanitation data, as well as information regarding years of potential life lost, and Human Development Index were collected. The dependent variable was the rate of homicides in the period 2004 to 2006. In order to verify the relationship between the outcome variable and the predictor variables, we performed a multivariate linear regression model. Results: We found associations between social determinants and the rate of mortality by homicides. Variables related to income and education were proven determinants for mortality. The multiple regression model showed that 51% of homicides in Fortaleza neighborhoods are explained by years of potential life lost, proportion of households with poor housing, average years of schooling, per capita income and percentage of household heads with 15 or more years of study. The coefficients for years of potential life lost and households with poor housing were positive. Conclusion: The findings indicate that the mortality by homicide is associated with high levels of poverty and uncontrolled urbanization, which migrates to the peripheries of urban centers.","This cross-sectional ecological design study took as the analysis unit 114 official neighborhoods in Fortaleza, seeking to identify the influence of social determinants of health in the behavior of homicide rates in this metropolis. This is configured as a metropolitan agglomeration in the Northeast of Brazil, ranked the fifth largest city in the country in population, estimated by FIGBE in 2,505,554 million inhabitants for the year of 2009, with an annual growth rate of 2.2%. This estimate considered that 53.2% were female and 35.3% were aged 0 - 19 years. However, despite being the fifth largest city in number of inhabitants in Brazil, the United Nations (UN) identified Fortaleza as one of four Brazilian cities in which large social differences are reported, in addition to Brasília, Goiânia and Belo Horizonte8. When compared to other cities in the world (138), these Brazilian cities only lose to Johannesburg, Buffalo City and Ekurhuleni, all South African. Fortaleza occupied the 17th position in the ranking of the 20 most unequal cities in the world, which has given Brazil a rankings of a Country with high inequality (Gini coefficient of 0.58), losing only to South Africa, Zambia and Namibia8. In the operationalization of this study, the 2000 demographic census conducted by FIGBE, the components of the Human Development Index for Municipal Districts (IDHM-B) defined by the Department of Planning in Fortaleza (SEPLA), the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health (SIM/MS), obtained at the Department of Municipal Health (SMS) of the city and the data on the deaths of the Medical Legal Institute (IML) of Fortaleza constituted the data sources. Some criteria were elected in the definition/inclusion of variables. In relation to death, were considered as valid deaths by homicide, residents and occurred in Fortaleza between January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006 and codified by the X Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) in its Chapter XX8, including codes X91-Y09. The data extracted from the aforementioned sources originated two blocks of indicators that constituted the predictor variables: the first concerning socioeconomic information, and the second, demographic information, as well as the homicide mortality rate as the outcome. The first block was composed of the following indicators: average nominal income; per capita income; average years of education; human development index per neighborhood; proportion of households with water supply; proportion of people with early and late literacy; proportion of people with high incomes; proportion of heads of households under the poverty line and below it; proportion of heads of households in relation to years of education; proportion of poor households; proportion of households with garbage collection. The second block was formed by the population and housing density; proportion of youth and longevity. As independent variables, the attributes age, sex, years of life lost, IDHM-B, data of education and income, water supply and garbage collection were used. In this study, the indicator of mortality (years of life lost) was used as an explanatory variable in an attempt to show the magnitude of the extermination of young people. In pursuit of methodological rigor and refining in the quality of information, probabilistic linkage techniques between the SIM database and the IML (Fortaleza) database ensured that purpose by complementing information (deaths by homicide) in the database designed to this study, using the public domain program RECLINK III 3.1.6.31609. Seeking normal variable distribution and stabilization of variance, transformation of the following types was performed: inverse, square root and log-neperian for the outcome (average incidence rate of homicides) and predictor variables. The choice of log-neperian function is justified for demonstrating to be best fit to the data set, as assessed by normality. The variables included in the multivariate model resulted from the Pearson correlation matrix and presented p < 0.25 in the bivariate analysis. In the final model, variables considered significant presented p < 0.05. This study complied with the ethical precepts (Referência da Resolução), and was approved with under protocol n. 257/08 by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade do Ceará (COMEPE)."
"The role of childhood neglect and childhood poverty in predicting mental health, academic achievement and crime in adulthood",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21116706/,"Nikulina, V., Widom, C. S., & Czaja, S. (2011). The role of childhood neglect and childhood poverty in predicting mental health, academic achievement and crime in adulthood. American journal of community psychology, 48(3-4), 309–321. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10464-010-9385-y","This study examines the roles of childhood neglect and childhood poverty (family and neighborhood) in predicting Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), academic achievement, and crime in young adulthood. Using existing data from a prospective cohort design study, 1,005 children with documented histories of neglect (N = 507) and matched controls (N = 497) were interviewed in young adulthood (mean age 29). Official criminal histories were also used to assess outcomes. Data were analyzed using logistic and ordinary least squares regressions and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to control for neighborhood clustering. Results from HLM revealed that childhood neglect and childhood family poverty uniquely predicted PTSD and adult arrest, MDD was predicted only by childhood family poverty, and a significant interaction between childhood family poverty and childhood neighborhood poverty predicted academic achievement for the control group only. Childhood neglect, childhood family poverty, and childhood neighborhood poverty each contribute to poor outcomes later in life. While interventions should be developed for neglected children to prevent negative outcomes, the current findings suggest that it is also important to consider the ecological context in which these children are growing up.","Procedure The data used here are from a large research project based on a prospective cohort design study in which abused and/ or neglected children were matched with non-victimized children and followed prospectively into young adulthood (Widom 1989a). Because of the matching procedure, the subjects are assumed to differ only in the risk factor: that is, having experienced childhood abuse or neglect. Since it is not possible to randomly assign subjects to groups, the assumption of equivalency for the groups is an approximation. Cases were drawn from the records of county juvenile and adult criminal courts in a metropolitan area in the Midwest during the years 1967 through 1971. The rationale for identifying the maltreated group was that their cases were serious enough to come to the attention of the authorities. Only court-substantiated cases of child maltreatment were included. Cases were restricted to those in which the children were less than 11 years of age at the time of the abuse or neglect incident. In this paper, we focus only on neglected children. Neglect cases reflected a judgment that the parents’ deficiencies in childcare were beyond those found acceptable by community and professional standards at the time. These cases represented extreme failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical attention to children. Excluded from the sample were court cases that represented: (1) adoption of the child as an infant; (2) “involuntary” neglect only (usually resulting from the temporary institutionalization of the legal guardian); (3) placement only (where there was no indication of neglect but the need to find a home for the child); or (4) failure to pay child support. A critical element of the design involved the selection of a comparison group, matched with the maltreated sample on the basis of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and approximate family social class during the time period under study. Matching for approximate family social class was important in this study because it is theoretically plausible that any relation between child abuse and neglect and subsequent outcomes may be confounded with or explained by social class differences. It is difficult to match exactly for social class because higher income families could live in lower social class neighborhoods and vice versa. The matching procedure used here is based on a broad definition of social class that includes neighborhoods in which children were reared and schools they attended. Similar procedures, with neighborhood school matches, have been used in studies of schizophrenics (Watt 1972) to match approximately for social class. The control group establishes the base rates of pathology we would expect in a sample of adults from comparable circumstances who did not come to court attention in childhood as victims of neglect. Where possible, two matches were found to allow for loss of comparison group members. Any comparison group child with an official record of abuse or neglect was eliminated, regardless of whether the record was before or after the period of the study. This occurred in 11 cases. Children who were under school age at the time of the neglect were matched with children of the same sex, race, date of birth (±1 week), and hospital of birth through the use of county birth record information. For children of school age, records of more than 100 elementary schools for the same time period were used to find matches with children of the same sex, race, date of birth (±6 months), class in elementary school during the years 1967 through 1971, and approximate home address. We were not able to find matches for some neglected children because: (1) date of birth information was missing for the neglected child; (2) the neglected child was born outside the county and/or state; (3) the elementary school that the child attended had closed since 1971 and class registers were not available; and (4) the school was not integrated at the time and a same race match could not be found. Overall, there were matches for 76% of the neglected children. Initially, we examined official criminal histories for the entire sample of maltreated children and compared them to those of the matched comparison group (N = 1,575) (Widom 1989a). For this paper, we use data from the second phase of the study which involved tracing, locating, and interviewing these individuals an average of 22.30 years later (SD = 2.10). Two-hour in-person interviews that included a series of structured and semi-structured questionnaires and rating scales were conducted between 1989 and 1995 obtaining information about cognitive, intellectual, emotional, psychiatric, social and interpersonal functioning. The interviewers were blind to the purpose of the study, to the participants’ group membership, and to the inclusion of a maltreated group. Similarly, the subjects were blind to the purpose of the study and were told they had been selected to participate as part of a large group of individuals who grew up in that area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After being provided with a description of the study, subjects signed a consent form acknowledging that they were participating voluntarily. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the procedures involved in this study. For those individuals with limited reading ability, the consent form was read and, if necessary, explained verbally. Of the original sample of 1,575 (908 abused and/or neglected individuals and 667 controls), 1,307 subjects (83.00%) were located and 1,196 interviewed (76.00%). Of the people not interviewed, 43 were deceased (prior to interview), 8 were incapable of being interviewed, 268 were not found, and 60 refused to participate (a refusal rate of 3.80%). There were no significant differences between the interviewed sample (N = 1,196) and the original sample (N = 1,575) in terms of demographic characteristics (gender, race, or current age) or group status (neglect versus comparison group). Participants Only participants who had a history of childhood neglect or were in the control group and were White or Black (not of Hispanic origin) were included in the present analyses (N = 1,004). Individuals who reported being of Hispanic origin (N = 59, 5.60%) were excluded from these analyses because their small numbers make it difficult to generalize to Hispanics. The majority of the neglect group (88.40%, N = 446) had a documented case of neglect only and the remaining 11.60% had experienced one or more types of abuse in addition to their neglect. The sample here has a mean age of 29.14 (SD = 3.84), 47.30% are female, and 35.50% are Black. There were no differences between the controls and neglected group on race and gender. However, those in the control group were 8 months older than the neglected participants (t = −2.47, p \ .05). On average, the participants completed 11.49 (SD = 2.20) years of school and the median occupational level (Hollingshead 1975) for the groups was semiskilled workers, with only 6.60% of the overall sample in the managerial/professional category. Thus, the sample is skewed toward the lower-end of the socio-economic spectrum."
Sexual Violence in the Backlands: Toward a Macro-Level Understanding of Rural Sex Crime (INCOMPLETE METHODS),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24501209/,"Braithwaite J. (2015). Sexual Violence in the Backlands: Toward a Macro-Level Understanding of Rural Sex Crimes. Sexual abuse : a journal of research and treatment, 27(5), 496–523. https://doi.org/10.1177/1079063214521471","This research focuses on structural covariates of sex crimes in rural communities (using urban and urbanizing communities as comparison groups), with particular analysis on exploring how the magnitude and direction of such covariates differ with respect to type of sex crime. Using 2000 sex crime data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for the population of reporting U.S. cities, negative binomial and logistic regression procedures were used to explore the relationship between resource disadvantage, local investment, and economic inequality and sex crime subtypes. For sex crimes that occurred almost exclusively in the home, urban and urbanizing community rates were largely influenced by resource disadvantage and local investment, while these measures did not reach significance for explaining rural rates. Conversely, local investment was a significant predictor of sex crimes that occurred outside the home in rural communities. This research indicates that a structural analysis of sexual victimization (widely absent from the scientific literature) does yield significant findings and that disaggregation of crime into subtypes allows for a more detailed differentiation between urban and rural communities.","The current study utilizes U.S. cities and towns as the unit of analysis. To the author’s knowledge, this study is the first to use this unit of analysis in rural sociological research. Processes of rural violence customarily have been explored at the county level (Lee, 2008; Lee & Thomas, 2010; Osgood & Chambers, 2000; Petee & Kowalski, 1993; Weisheit & Wells, 2005). Although some defense of this method is offered (e.g., rural counties have strong internal economic and governmental structure), counties appear to be utilized largely as a matter of convenience. Most counties have several distinct communities within them. In other words, it is not uncommon for counties to contain urbanized clusters, as well as small farming communities. To this end, cities and towns were selected as the unit of analysis given the level of abstraction at which social disorganization processes are cast. In generating the sample, Census definitions guided the construction of the unit of analysis with respect to defining “urban” and “rural.” The Census 2000 classified “urban” as all territory, population, and housing units located within urbanized areas (urban areas with a population more than 50,000) or urbanized clusters (urban areas with a population under 50,000). The Census Bureau’s classification of “rural,” conversely, consists of territory, population, and households outside of urbanized areas and urbanized clusters. This schema allows for the possibility of a city housing rural and urban populations. For example, a city with a total population of 1,200 may consist of 935 individuals (77.9%) located in urbanized clusters and the remaining 265 (22.1%) housed in rural geographic areas. For analytic purposes, separate models were run for exclusively rural communities (defined as communities with 100% of the population housed in rural areas), exclusively urban communities (defined as communities with 100% of the population housed in urban areas or clusters), and urbanizing communities (communities with urban and rural households). The final database consisted of 1,647 cities and towns, covering 20 U.S. states,1 which represents the entire population of available city-level sex crime data from National Incident-Based Reporting Systems (NIBRS) for the year 2000."

The data originated from a cluster randomized controlled trial of a World Food Program Cash, Voucher, and Food Transfer intervention conducted by IFPRI; additional information on the intervention can be found in previous publications (Hidrobo et al., 2014; Hidrobo et al., 2016). The current study does not use the data to evaluate the intervention but takes advantage of existing longitudinal data to build our empirical knowledge base about predictors of IPV. Study Setting The data were collected in two provinces in northern Ecuador near the Colombian border—Carchi and Sucumbíos. Carchi is in the northern highlands and Sucumbíos is in the Amazonian lowlands, representing differing geographic, cultural, and socio-economic contexts. Within the two provinces, seven urban and peri-urban areas were included, which are characterized by a high concentration of refugees and a poverty index that exceeds 50%. Neighborhoods, as defined by local government, were then selected for inclusion based on having a high percentage of Colombian and low-income households. Sample Description The sample includes 80 neighborhoods; Maas and Hox (2005) have found that estimates derived from multi-level models with Level 2 sample size of 50 or higher provide reliable estimates. Neighborhoods were divided into 148 clusters. Households were mapped in each cluster and a one-page questionnaire with basic demographic and socio-economic questions was conducted to determine inclusion; 20–27 low-income households were then randomly selected to be surveyed. Colombian and Colombian-Ecuadorian households were oversampled. At Time 1, 2,357 households agreed to be surveyed; 2,122 households participated again approximately seven–eight months later. In total, 1,312 women were partnered at both time points and were either the head of the household or their spouse, thus qualifying to be asked the IPV module. Data Collection and Ethics Paper surveys were administered and verbal consent was collected. Field staff were trained in accordance with the WHO ethical guidelines for conducting research on IPV. Training topics included ethical recruitment, consent, and data collection procedures; ensuring participant safety, privacy, and confidentiality; and safe data practices. Specific procedures were in place to ensure the safety of the participant during data collection. For example, IPV questions were only asked if no other family members were present, including her partner. In addition, all women, regardless of if the women had disclosed IPV or not, were offered anonymized referral information with contact information for local services. IRB approval was obtained from the IFPRI and in-country data collection partner, Centro de Estudios de Población y Desarrollo Social. The data are publicly available and the ethics review board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill approved secondary data analysis. Measures Measures are described in detail in Table 1. In our analysis, we take advantage of both Time 1 and Time 2 data. Independent variables (e.g., social disorganization, household psychosocial stressors) were measured at Time 1, while our dependent (IPV) variables were measured at Time 2. The dependent variables assess emotional and physical and/or sexual IPV in the last six months (yes/no) using the WHO Violence Against Women Instrument (Ellsberg & Heise, 2005). Using the full sample at Time 1 (n = 2,357), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted in MPLUS to identify underlying latent constructs of social disorganization and social cohesion. Both EFA and CFA analyses accounted for categorical response distributions and the clustered structure of the dataset. We identified one underlying factor of social disorganization, which included neighborhood averages of wealth, female-headed households, household ownership, and residential instability (i.e., concentration of households that had moved to the neighborhood in the last 20 years). Social cohesion included four domains: trust in individuals; trust in institutions and community connectedness; experiences of discrimination; and civic engagement. Indicators of model fit were high. Social cohesion CFA results can be found in Supplemental Table A; Supplemental Table B documents domain correlations. Indicators of migration history, psychosocial stressors, experiences of recent discrimination, household wealth, food security, social support, and civic engagement were included at the household level. Key household-level independent variables were centered within the neighborhood. Neighborhood-level independent variables were grand-mean centered (i.e., centered around the entire sample’s mean). Centering allows us to parse out within-neighborhood variance and between-neighborhood variance, therefore allowing us to understand the compositional and contextual effects, respectively, of these variables on IPV outcomes (Enders & Tofighi, 2007). We also weighted neighborhood-level aggregates to account for the over-representation of Colombian households in our sample. Neighborhood scores (e.g., social disorganization) were standardized to reflect a change in odds ratio per one standard deviation change in predictor, and neighborhood averages (e.g., percent of renters) were scaled to reflect change in odds ratio per 10% change in predictor. Analysis We conducted an attrition analysis to examine if women who were partnered at Time 1 and then lost to follow-up at Time 2, were different from our study sample. Overall, 12.8% of women that were partnered at Time 1 were lost to follow-up or refused to participate at Time 2. Supplementary Table C presents associations between attrition and key independent variables. We found some evidence of differential attrition: households with Colombian male partners and households that had moved to the neighborhood in the last 20 years were more likely to attrit. We then assessed the pattern of missing data: 3.6% and 2.1% of women were missing data for IPV at Time 1 and Time 2, respectively. We conducted joint multi-level multiple imputations, accounting for categorical variables and for the hierarchical nature of the dataset. We then conducted multi-level logistic regression to examine the variance in IPV outcomes attributable to individual, partner, household, and neighborhood-level characteristics. Maximum likelihood parameter estimates were generated with standard errors robust to non-normality and non-independence of observations. Random intercepts were included in the models to account for unexplained neighborhood clustering related to IPV. We conducted a 2-2-1 cross-level mediation analysis to see if social cohesion mediated the relationship between social disorganization and IPV. All models controlled for female age, education, and ethnicity; province; intervention status (pooled treatment); and IPV at Time 1."
Community context and individual factors associated with arrests among young men in a South African township,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30653530/,"Christodoulou, J., Stokes, L. R., Bantjes, J., Tomlinson, M., Stewart, J., Rabie, S., Gordon, S., Mayekiso, A., & Rotheram-Borus, M. J. (2019). Community context and individual factors associated with arrests among young men in a South African township. PloS one, 14(1), e0209073. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209073","Background: In high-income countries, individual- and community-level factors are associated with increased contact with the criminal justice system. However, little is known about how these factors contribute to the risk of arrest in South Africa, which has one of the highest rates of arrests globally. We examine both individual- and community-level factors associated with arrests among young men living in the townships of Cape Town. Methods: Data were collected from a stratified community sample of 906 young men aged 18-29 years old living in 18 township neighborhoods. Communities with high and low rates of arrest were identified. Logistic regression models were used to assess which individual-level (such as substance use and mental health status) and community-level (such as infrastructure and presence of bars and gangs) factors predict arrests. Results: Significant predictors of arrests were substance use, gang activity, being older, more stressed, and less educated. Living in communities with better infrastructure and in more recently established communities populated by recent immigrants was associated with having a history of arrests. Conclusions: When considering both individual- and community-level factors, substance use and gang violence are the strongest predictors of arrests among young men in South Africa. Unexpectedly, communities with better infrastructure have higher arrest rates. Community programs are needed to combat substance use and gang activity as a pathway out of risk among South African young men.","The Institutional Review Boards of the University of California, Los Angeles (IRB#14–001587) and Stellenbosch University (N14/08/116) approved this study [38] (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-018-2804-3). Participants Community clusters (n = 18) containing approximately 450–600 households, including roughly 50 young men per neighborhood, were identified in two Cape Town townships: Khayelitsha (including Makaza, Harare, Ndlovini) and Mfuleni. In each community, a random spot was selected, and recruitment proceeded house-to-house in concentric circles until a sample of 50 young men aged 18 to 29 was reached. If other household members reported that there was a male that slept there at least four nights a week, the interviewer returned repeatedly to solicit voluntary participation of the young man. Potential participants were only excluded if they were unable to understand the recruiter, appeared to be actively hallucinating, or lacked capacity to consent. Individuals who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the time of recruitment were enrolled in the study, but were only interviewed once they were no longer intoxicated. Assessments were conducted at a local research facility in the township, with transport provided. Of the 994 men approached, 5% (n = 50) declined to participate or were identified but could not be found later to complete the assessment (n = 34). The final sample included 906 young men aged 18–29 years old (M = 22.2, SD = 2.9). Assessments Trained interviewers administered a one-hour interview, entering the young men’s responses on an encrypted mobile phone, which transmits data to an encrypted file at the earliest possible time. Participants were reimbursed with ZAR 70 (about 5 USD) for their time to complete the interview. Materials Each of the following individual-level factors were self-reported by the young men. History of arrests Participants reported whether they had ever been arrested (1) or not (0). Self-report measures are one of the most common techniques to collect data on delinquent and criminal behavior, and have been shown to demonstrate sufficient reliability and validity [39]. Individual-level factors Demographics. Participants reported their age, education level, whether they were living with the family of origin, partnership status (partnered or single), whether they had children, and their employment history. Risk History. Reports of recent drug use (alcohol, cannabis, and methamphetamine) were both self-reported and assessed by Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT). Alcohol use was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), a brief, reliable, and valid, three-item questionnaire of problematic alcohol use [14, 40, 41]. Participants also self-reported their consumption of alcohol in the last three days as well as cannabis and methamphetamine in the last two days, and were assessed with urine-based RDT sold by CLIAwaived Inc. (San Diego, CA). The cannabis RDT (CLIA-SDDT-10) detects 11-nor-Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid as low as 50 ng/mL over the last 30 days. The methamphetamine RDT (CLIA-SDDT-16) detects methamphetamine as low as 500 ng/mL over the last four days. Although self-report data has been found to be a valid measure of substance use among this sample, the level of agreement between self-report and RDT can vary between substances [42]. Health Status. Participants reported whether they had ever been tested for HIV, whether they had tested for HIV in the last 6 months, their HIV status, and whether they have had any sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Symptoms of depression were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression (CES-D) with a cutoff of >16 taken to indicate clinically significant symptoms of depression [43]. The CES-D scale was found reliable in previous research in SA [44]. Perceived stress was also assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), a 10-item scale focused on stress over the last month, with a cutoff of >13 to indicate above average stress [45]. The PSS was found valid and reliable in previous studies in Asia [46]. Community-level factors Each of the following community-level factors were measured using: 1) official government areal maps; 2) images from Google Earth, 3) research assistants systematically canvassing the neighborhoods at multiple times during the day and evening on weekdays and weekends, and 4) brief street-intercepted surveys of young men in the neighborhoods (some of whom were recruited for the current study if they lived in the households approached for recruitment and were 18 to 29 years old as previously described). For each of the 18 community clusters, we assessed the level of infrastructure (proportion of formal versus informal housing, source of water (i.e., community pump, water on premises, and whether the household had a flush toilet) and the number of bars (shebeens) by household in each community [11, 47]. Therefore, we mapped the locations of all bars within each community, as government records do not provide a reliable measure of the actual number of these small and informal establishments. This data was consistent with the proportions of infrastructure self-reported by the young men. Food insecurity was assessed using one item (“How many days in the past week have you gone hungry?”) from The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). This item has been found to be highly correlated with the nine-item scale used to distinguish food insecure from food secure households in Cape Town townships and other cultural contexts [48–50]. Violence. Participants self-reported incidences of violent behavior, gang involvement, and violence against women. Statistical analyses First, individual-level and community-level risk factors were compared based on the history of arrests across all neighborhoods. As a first step, chi-squared analyses (df = 1) were used to identify significant covariates between young men who have been arrested and those who have not. From these identified covariates, the most relevant variables were entered into a multiple-predictor logistic regression to identify individual- and community- level risk factors associated with arrests. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented. To identify communities with a high versus low number of arrests, we compared the proportion of men who have ever been arrested in each neighborhood. Since less than half of the young men reported ever being arrested, a reasonable split of 25% of the communities with the highest arrest rates (5 neighborhoods, 41.0% young men ever arrested, n = 103/251) was compared with 25% of the communities with the lowest arrest rates (5 neighborhoods, 23.8% young men ever arrested, n = 60/252). We then compared measures of individual- and community-level risk factors between the communities with a high and low number of arrests using chi-squared analyses (df = 1). This enabled analysis between neighborhoods by comparing aggregate measures of community-level risk factors. All analyses were conducted using SPSS Statistics 23 (Chicago, IL) [51]. Go to:"
Spatial distribution and predictors of domestic violence against women: evidence from analysis of Ethiopian demographic health survey 2016,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34525981/,"Seid, E., Melese, T., & Alemu, K. (2021). Spatial distribution and predictors of domestic violence against women: evidence from analysis of Ethiopian demographic health survey 2016. BMC women's health, 21(1), 334. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-021-01465-4","Background: Violence against women particularly that is committed by an intimate partner is becoming a social and public health problem across the world. Studies show that the spatial variation in the distribution of domestic violence was commonly attributed to neighborhood-level predictors. Despite the prominent benefits of spatial techniques, research findings are limited. Therefore, the current study intends to determine the spatial distribution and predictors of domestic violence among women aged 15-49 in Ethiopia. Methods: Data from the Ethiopian demographic health survey 2016 were used to determine the spatial distribution of domestic violence in Ethiopia. Spatial auto-correlation statistics (both Global and Local Moran's I) were used to assess the spatial distribution of domestic violence cases in Ethiopia. Spatial locations of significant clusters were identified by using Kuldorff's Sat Scan version 9.4 software. Finally, binary logistic regression and a generalized linear mixed model were fitted to identify predictors of domestic violence. Result: The study found that spatial clustering of domestic violence cases in Ethiopia with Moran's I value of 0.26, Z score of 8.26, and P value < 0.01. The Sat Scan analysis identifies the primary most likely cluster in Oromia, SNNP regions, and secondary cluster in the Amhara region. The output from regression analysis identifies low economic status, partner alcohol use, witnessing family violence, marital controlling behaviors, and community acceptance of wife-beating as significant predictors of domestic violence. Conclusion: There is spatial clustering of IPV cases in Ethiopia. The output from regression analysis shows that individual, relationship, and community-level predictors were strongly associated with IPV. Based upon our findings, we give the following recommendation: The government should give prior concern for controlling factors such as high alcohol consumption, improper parenting, and community norm that encourage IPV that were responsible for IPV in the identified hot spot areas.","Study design and setting The study uses data that was extracted from EDHS 2016 dataset. In EDHS 2016, a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA) from January 18 to June 27, 2016, in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is an ancient country located in the Horn of Africa from 30 to 140 N and 330 to 480E. Ethiopia has a total area of 1,100,000 square kilometers and with over 110 million population and this makes it the second populous country in Africa. Ethiopia is a nation with around 80 ethnic groups. From this, the four largest are Oromo, Amhara, Somali, and Tigrayans. Regarding climatic conditions, Ethiopia is an ecologically diverse country ranging from desert in the eastern part to tropical rainforest to south and south-west. Figure 1 shows map of Ethiopia where the study has been conducted. Sample size and sampling technique EDHS 2016 used two stages stratified cluster sampling technique where each region was stratified into urban and rural areas, yielding 21 sampling strata. In the first stage, a total of 645 Enumeration Areas (EAs) were selected with probability proportional to EA size and with independent selection in each sampling stratum [7]. In the second stage, a fixed number of 28 households per cluster were selected and only one woman per household was randomly selected for interview. Finally, a total of 5860 women aged 15–49 were asked questions about domestic violence against women. All women aged 15–49 and who are the usual members of selected households and who stayed in the household the night before the survey were eligible to be interviewed [7]. Data collection procedures In the 2016 EDHS, questionnaires from the standard Demographic and Health Survey were adapted to reflect the population and health issues relevant to Ethiopia. The questionnaire was translated into local languages (Amharic, Tigrigna, and Oromiffa) to appropriately collect the information needed. Information about IPV was obtained by asking ever married woman a 13 item question; of which, 7 measures physical IPV, 3 emotional IPV, and 3 sexual IPV. Table ​Table11 contains questions used to measure emotional, physical, and sexual violence committed by their partners. The dependent variable of the study is the experience of domestic violence by women aged 15–49. A woman is said to be experienced domestic violence if she ever faced either emotional, physical, or sexual violence or a combination of the three committed by her partner. The independent variables are categorized into individual-level, household/relationship level, and community-level factors. Table ​Table22 lists variables used in the study with their measurements.Data processing and analysis Statistical analysis of the data was performed on SPSS version 25. Cross-tabulations and summary statistics have been carried out to describe populations by age, level of education, place of residence, and region. Binary logistic regression and a two-level generalized linear mixed model were employed to identify predictors of domestic violence. Finally, a model comparison between the models was performed based upon the Log-likelihood ratio test to choose the best-fitted model. Spatial analysis of domestic violence ArcGIS 10.7 software was used for spatial analysis of the data. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran’s I) statistics and Anselin local cluster analysis was performed to show the spatial distribution of domestic violence among woman aged 15–49 in Ethiopia. Global Moran’s I measure was used to verify whether domestic violence among women aged 15–49 is clustered, dispersed, or randomly distributed in Ethiopia. Global Moran’s I calculates Moran's I Index value, Z score & P value. Moran’s I index close to -1 means domestic violence cases are dispersed whereas, close to 1 indicates that domestic violence cases are clustered. Statistically significant Z-score and P value ≤ 0.05 lead to rejection of the null hypothesis showing the existence of clusters of domestic violence. Statistically non-significant Moran’s I value (if P value > 0.05) will indicate domestic violence cases are randomly distributed throughout the country [12]. Anselin local Moran’s I was used to identify local level clusters of domestic violence. A positive Local Moran’s I indicate that the feature is surrounded by features with similar values and, such types of cases are called clusters. Whereas, a negative value for I indicates that the feature is surrounded by features with dissimilar values, and this was called an outlier [12]. Kuldorff’s Sat Scan version 9.4 software was used to identify the geographical locations of statistically significant clusters of domestic violence. Scan statistics use a scanning window that moves across the study area. Bernoulli's model was fitted to identify statistically significant locations of domestic violence clusters. The Bernoulli model was selected because the structure of the data shows the binomial [0/1] distribution. Women who have experienced domestic violence were considered as case and labeled1 whereas, those who do not experience as control and labeled 0. The default 50% of the population was used as an upper limit for cluster size; because it allows the detection of both small and large clusters of domestic violence. Statistically significant clusters were identified by P value and likelihood ratio tests. Multi-level logistic regression analysis A two-level generalized linear mixed model was fitted by considering 4322 women aged 15–49 at level 1 nested within 645 clusters (communities) at level two. A multilevel analysis of the data takes three steps. The first step was fitting the null (intercept only) model without including predictor variables and the second step was a random intercept fixed coefficient model (model 2) by including individual and relationship level variables. The last was fitting a random intercept and fixed coefficient model (model 3) by incorporating community-level predictors. Model Comparison Model comparison between the nested (null model and random intercept fixed coefficient model) and the logistic regression model was done to select the best-fitted model. The commonly used parameter for evaluation of model fitness is the Log-likelihood ratio test that compares the deviance (-log likelihood) of the models by subtracting the smaller deviance from the larger one. Deviance is an indicator that shows how well the model fits the data. A model with the lowest deviance is considered as the best-fitted model than with large deviance. In addition to the log-likelihood ratio test, Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were also used as measures of model fitness to select the best one. Similar to the log-likelihood ratio test, the model with a small AIC and BIC value is considered as the better model.

Depression and Intimate Partner Violence Among African American Women Living in Impoverished Inner-City Neighborhoods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29294647/,"Mugoya, G. C. T., Witte, T., Bolland, A., Tomek, S., Hooper, L. M., Bolland, J., & George Dalmida, S. (2020). Depression and Intimate Partner Violence Among African American Women Living in Impoverished Inner-City Neighborhoods. Journal of interpersonal violence, 35(3-4), 899–923. https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517691519","Mental health correlates of intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization including negative physical and mental health outcomes are well documented. However, certain subgroups of African American women, such as those living in impoverished, urban communities, are underrepresented in most studies and may experience IPV at higher rates. Furthermore, the circumstances of this women including poverty makes them at risk to IPV and its consequences. The present study estimated the prevalence of IPV victimization and its association with depression in a sample of low-income African American women participating in the Mobile Youth and Poverty Study. Participants in this study were caregivers of adolescents living in extremely impoverished conditions and were part of the Mobile Youth Survey, a community-based, longitudinal, multiple cohort survey conducted between the years 1998 and 2011. Data for the current study were collected between the years 2001 and 2010. The dependent variable was depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). The independent variable was IPV measured using a subsample of items from the Conflict Tactics Scale. Nearly three quarters (73.6%, n = 489) of the sample experienced some form of IPV and 49.1% (n = 326) had a CES-D depression score of 16 or greater indicating mild to severe depression symptoms. The highest proportion of women who met the CES-D criteria for depression were those experiencing the most severe IPV irrespective of category (i.e., physical, psychological, or combined). Logistic regression analyses showed that women reporting the most severe abuse, irrespective of category, were significantly more likely to meet the CES-D criteria for depression. In addition, low education and receipt of economic assistance were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. The combination of poor economic conditions and IPV may predispose African American women living in impoverished, urban communities to mental health outcomes such as depression.","Participants and Recruitment Procedures The present study uses face-to-face interviews during home visitation to query participants about IPV victimization experiences and depressive symptoms. The data utilized in the current study is derived from the Mobile Youth Study (MYS), a multiple cohort, longitudinal study of poverty and adolescent risk. The MYS study was conducted in the most impoverished neighborhoods in the Mobile, Alabama Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) between 1998 and 2011. In 1998, MYS researchers identified the 13 poorest neighborhoods in the MSA and surveyed adolescents within those neighborhoods. The census data at the beginning of the study (i.e., 1990 census) showed that these neighborhoods had a median household income of US$5,190 and a 73% poverty rate (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012) The researchers followed participants as they moved throughout the study thus adding new neighborhoods. By 2011 the MYS was conducted in 50 neighborhoods (see A. C. Bolland, 2012; K. A. Bolland et al., 2016, for a discussion of MYS procedures and the MYS sample). The survey for the present study was administered cross-sectionally between the years 2001 and 2010 to a sample of adults (1,043: 180 men and 863 women) to caregivers of the original MYS participants. This secondary study was referred to as the Adult and Family Dynamics Questionnaire (AFDQ). Because of length, the AFDQ was separated into two sections and several subsections that could be completed at different times; not all participants completed all sections. The complete survey took approximately 3 hr to complete. Participants were compensated for their time between US$12 and US$50 (depending on the number of sections completed). The University of Alabama’s Institutional Review Board approved the study. Given that the objective of the current study is to examine IPV victimization among African American women, out of the 1,043 respondents who were administered the AFDQ, men (n = 180) were excluded. Also excluded were women who did not self-identify as African American (n = 73) and those without information on interpersonal violence (n = 126). The final sample thus contained 664 adult African American women. The mean age of participants was 38.9 years (SD = 12.9). Many participants were unmarried, but currently dating (38.6%, n = 256); some participants had never married and were not dating (29.2%, n = 194); 15.2% were separated or divorced and not currently dating (n = 101); a few were currently married (6.0%, n = 40) or widowed (6.9%, n = 46); and marital status could not be ascertained on 4.1% (n = 27) of the participants. A majority of the participants (88.1%, n = 585) received economic assistance and 11.9% (n = 79) did not report receiving economic assistance. In this sample, 60.1% (n = 397) had completed high school or received GED and 39.9% (n = 264) had not completed high school or received a GED. Measures Dependent variable Depressive risk, as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), served as the dependent variable in this study. The CES-D is a 20-item measure where participants indicate how often, over the past week, they experienced symptoms associated with depression, such as restless sleep, poor appetite, and feeling lonely. Participants rate the extent to which they have experienced each of these symptoms none of the time (=0), rarely (=1), some or little of the time (=2), or most or all of the time (=3). For this scale, total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. The CES-D was designed to measure depressive experiences in the general population and includes items reflecting major dimensions of depression including depressed affect, positive affect, somatic symptoms/retarded activity, and interpersonal (Radloff, 1977). The CES-D has been validated in a general population and clinical patient samples (e.g., Chung et al., 2015; Foley, Reed, Mutran, & DeVellis, 2002) and has been utilized in ascertaining depressive symptoms among individuals both current and lifetime IPV (Bonomi et al., 2006; Zlotnick, Johnson, & Kohn, 2006). Internal consistency for the scale in general and clinical populations is very good (α = .85 and .90, respectively; see Radloff, 1977). The internal reliability of the CES-D for the present study was α = .83). A cutoff score of 16 or greater has been shown to be an indicator of individuals at risk for clinical depression, with good sensitivity and specificity as well as high internal consistency (Lewinsohn, Seeley, Roberts, & Allen, 1997). Thus, depressive symptoms were dichotomized into less than 16 (=0) and equal or greater than 16 (=1) to distinguish those at risk for clinical depression. The CES-D mean score for the current sample was 17.0 (SD = 10.5), and 49.1% (n = 326) of the sample had CES-D scores equal or greater than 16. Independent variables IPV served as the independent variable and was measured using select items from the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, & Sugarman, 1996). The CTS2 measures 39 self-rated behaviors (or acts) coded into five categories: (a) negotiation (six items), (b) physical assault (12 items), (c) sexual coercion (seven items), (d) psychological aggression (eight items), and (e) injury (six items). Each category is composed of items that represent a range of severity. A strength of the CTS2 is that it allows items to be classified into categories and classified by severity level (e.g., minor and severe; Strauss et al., 1996). The CTS2 has been used in many studies involving both married and dating partners with evidence of reliability and validity (e.g., Archer, 1999; Straus, 2004). For instance, Straus and colleagues reported internal consistency reliability of .86 for the Physical Assault subscale and .79 for the Psychological Aggression subscale. To accommodate the various questions asked, the researchers limited questions in the AFDQ to only two subscales of the CTS2 (i.e., Psychological Aggression and Physical Assault; see Table 1). These two scales provided information that was deemed sufficient to answer the current study’s research questions. The individual items in each subscale were weighted according to their severity, with the act associated with questionnaire item being categorized as minor or severe (Straus et al., 1996). Scoring was conducted using the prevalence method, which indicates whether one or more of the acts in the scale occurs and does not differentiate on the basis of how many of the acts occurred or how often each act was used (Straus, 2004). The Physical Assault subscale (PhA) was categorized and coded as follows: respondents indicating that they had experienced any severe form of IPV from either a current and/or past relationship were categorized as (a) having experienced severe IPV (coded as 2), (b) those who experienced minor IPV and no severe IPV either from a current and/or past relationship were categorized as minor (coded as 1), and (c) those who had never experienced any IPV either in their current and/or past relationship were categorized as none (coded as 0). Thus, the Physical Assault subscale (PhA) was coded as 0 = none, 1 = minor, and 2 = severe. The Psychological Aggression severity subscale (PsA) was categorized and coded in the same way. The internal consistency coefficients for the Physical Assault scale and Psychological Aggression scale were very good (α = .85 and .80 respectively). The participant distribution on the Physical Assault subscale was as follows: none (52.8%, n = 351); minor (21.5%, n = 143); severe (25.6%, n = 170). While for psychological aggression, the distribution was none (27.3%, n = 181); minor (28.3%, n = 188); severe (44.4%, n = 295). Cognizant that violence does not occur in isolation (i.e., a woman experiencing physical violence is also likely to experience psychological violence) and that the effect of experiencing both severe psychological and severe physical violence on depression is likely to be higher than experiencing either type on its own, a four-category composite IPV severity scale (CoS) was used. Previous studies have evaluated the effect of co-occurrence of physical and psychological violence. Demographic and other covariates Previous research indicates that various demographic and socioeconomic factors influence the relationship between experiencing IPV and depressive symptoms (e.g., Chuang et al., 2012; González-Guarda, Peragallo, Vasquez, Urrutia, & Mitrani, 2009; Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000). For instance, Chuang and colleagues in a population-based longitudinal survey of women aged 18 to 45 found that in addition to IPV, older age, lower educational attainment, and lower household income were all significant predictors of depression. Thus, additional variables collected as part of the AFDQ were included in the analyses to control for possible confounding. As a measure of poverty, respondents were asked whether they received public support, including unemployment insurance benefits, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and supplemental security income (SSI). If they indicated that they received benefits from any of these programs, public support was coded as 1; otherwise it was coded as 0. Participants were also asked to report their age and marital status. Age in years was categorized and coded as follows: 19 to 24 (=1); 25 to 34; (=2); 35 to 44 (=3); 45 to 54 (=4); 5 = 55 plus (=4), while for marital status the coding was never married (=1); not dating, dating/engaged (=2); currently married (=3); separated/divorced and not currently dating (=4); unknown (=1). Finally, participants were asked to indicate their education level, which was dichotomized and coded as did not complete high school (=0); high school completion, GED, or more (=1). Analysis Plan All the analyses were conducted in STATA12 (StataCorp, 2015). Descriptive analyses were first conducted. Next, the proportion of women reporting various acts of IPV committed by the previous, current partner, and any partner(s) was obtained. Chi-square tests were conducted to establish the relationship between meeting CES-D criteria for depression and the various predictor variables. This was followed by t tests with corrections on the significant relationships to ascertain the specific proportions that were significant. Finally, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between meeting the CES-D criteria for depressive symptoms and IPV. Given preliminary bivariate analyses between the various IPV measures (i.e., physical assault, psychological aggression, and composite IPV severity scale), showing that there was high correlation between the variables coefficients (Cramér’s V values ranged from 0.51 to 0.77), three separate logistic regression analyses for each type of IPV (i.e., physical assault, psychological aggression, and composite IPV severity scale) were conducted."
Examining the Neighborhood Attributes of Recently Housed Partner Violence Survivors in Rapid Rehousing,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33920892/,"Holliday, C. N., Bevilacqua, K., Grace, K. T., Denhard, L., Kaur, A., Miller, J., & Decker, M. R. (2021). Examining the Neighborhood Attributes of Recently Housed Partner Violence Survivors in Rapid Rehousing. International journal of environmental research and public health, 18(8), 4177. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18084177","Survivors' considerations for re-housing following intimate partner violence (IPV) are understudied despite likely neighborhood-level influences on women's safety. We assess housing priorities and predictors of re-housing location among recent IPV survivors (n = 54) in Rapid Re-housing (RRH) in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. Choropleth maps depict residential location relative to census tract characteristics (neighborhood deprivation index (NDI) and residential segregation) derived from American Community Survey data (2013-2017). Linear regression measured associations between women's individual, economic, and social factors and NDI and segregation. In-depth interviews (n = 16) contextualize quantitative findings. Overall, survivors re-housed in significantly more deprived and racially segregated census tracts within their respective regions. In adjusted models, trouble securing housing (B = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.13, 1.34), comfortability with proximity to loved ones (B = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.02, 1.48), and being unsure (vs unlikely) about IPV risk (B = -0.76, 95% CI: -1.39, -0.14) were significantly associated with NDI. Economic dependence on an abusive partner (B = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.56, -0.06) predicted re-housing in segregated census tracts; occasional stress about housing affordability (B = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.75) predicted re-housing in less segregated census tracts. Qualitative results contextualize economic (affordability), safety, and social (familiarity) re-housing considerations and process impacts (inspection delays). Structural racism, including discriminatory housing practices, intersect with gender, exacerbating challenges among survivors of severe IPV. This mixed-methods study further highlights the significant economic tradeoffs for safety and stability, where the prioritization of safety may exacerbate economic devastation for IPV survivors. Findings will inform programmatic policies for RRH practices among survivors.","The study occurred in Baltimore, Maryland, where residential segregation ordinances took root in 1910 [49]. Baltimore soon became a template for other cities’ adoption of discriminatory housing policies, resulting in formalized redlining policies nationwide [49,50]. Redlining is a form of structural racism initiated by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) that was later reinforced by the federal government and real estate associations through formal and informal policies and practices. The HOLC outlined the boundaries of predominately Black neighborhoods in red to signify “at-risk” areas to be disqualified from investment and impeded Black families from purchasing homes in predominately White neighborhoods [51]. Restrictive covenants between property owners and real estate codes of ethics further segregated Black communities [50]. Such acts contributed to entrenched health disparities due to neighborhood disenfranchisement and a significant Black-White wealth gap [52] that stifled intergenerational wealth, which is often achieved through real estate [51,53]. In Baltimore City, the lingering impact of such policies is evidenced by the infamous “Black Butterfly” and “White L”, resemblances that demarcate clusters of deprivation and affluence [46]. The “Black Butterfly” outlines poverty, resource deserts, and a concentration of Black residents across the city’s East and West divisions. Conversely, the “White L” divides these two areas, extending into the Baltimore Inner Harbor and once-redlined surrounding areas marked by a significantly higher median income and life expectancy, an abundance of resources (e.g., electric scooters, well-resourced schools, free bus rides, a more significant number of business and mortgage loans), and a lower concentration of Black residents [46]. Recent evaluations and reports in lay media conclude that covert discriminatory practices are still effective today [50,54]. 2.2. Participants This study was completed with women who have experienced IPV and homelessness. For the sake of space, we refer to them as survivors because they were able to meet with us and share their experiences. Not all women who experience IPV are as fortunate. IPV survivors were recruited from a local domestic violence agency to participate in a longitudinal evaluation of two housing interventions—transitional housing (TH) and rapid re-housing (RRH). The RRH services were tailored to each survivor to include assistance in locating and obtaining housing and monthly rental assistance for a period determined by income level. This analysis comprises baseline data from survivors in the RRH program (June 2019–December 2020). Individuals were eligible to participate in the study if they were at least 18 years old, identified as female, experienced past-year IPV, including physical or sexual violence or threats of violence, could participate in English, and were enrolled in RRH at the partnering site. Only survivors who were actively participating in RRH services and receiving rental assistance were enrolled in the study. Thus, survivors waiting to be housed or no longer receiving rental assistance were ineligible to participate until the inclusion criteria were met. Survivors who completed the final follow-up survey at six months were asked to participate in a qualitative interview until saturation was met. 2.3. Data Collection Procedures 2.3.1. Survey Data Collection We actively recruited survivors during their scheduled visits to the domestic violence agency and passively through flyers distributed by their service coordinators. Upon confirmation of eligibility, oral informed consent and baseline data collection took place in a private area within the agency. Housing program staff facilitated and accompanied our team for at-home informed consent and data collection for women who could not travel to the agency and to mitigate participant burden. All research activities were conducted remotely with the program and study staff’s assistance following state-wide restrictions on in-person research due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Survivors completed a computer-assisted baseline survey via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) [55,56], a secure, web-based data application. REDCap increased survivors’ privacy, confidentiality, and safety for the inclusion of geo-linked data. 2.3.2. Participant-Facilitated Geocoding The feasibility of participant-facilitated geocoding was assessed to increase survivor safety, eliminating the need to collect survivors’ addresses. Instead, survivors self-recorded their census tract data using the US Census Bureau’s Geocoder [57]. Specifically, survivors were directed to the Geocoder website [57] through REDCap. They were instructed to input their current address and press “enter” to execute geocoding. Survivors copied the output (“GEOID” and “TRACT”) in a designated area of the active survey with support from the research assistant before deleting the browser history on the encrypted device. Women enrolled in housing programs are potentially the most at-risk of severe IPV and intimate partner homicide among IPV survivors [12,58]. Participant-facilitated geocoding strengthens safety protocols among this vulnerable population. 2.3.3. Qualitative Data Collection After completing the six-month follow-up survey, survivors were invited to participate in an in-depth interview via a secure web platform due to withstanding pandemic restrictions. Sixteen in-depth interviews were conducted by trained research assistants using a semi-structured guide between March 2020 and February 2021. Interview questions covered topics such as the participant’s housing selection, the impact of housing on abuse experiences, economic stability, children, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on housing, abuse, ongoing needs, and continued barriers to safety and housing stability. Survivors gave consent for digital audio recording. Recordings were transcribed by a transcription service and checked for accuracy by research assistants. Any identifying information inadvertently revealed was removed during transcription to ensure confidentiality. Digital recordings and transcripts were stored on a secure, encrypted computer. Survivors who completed the interview received a $25 retail gift card to thank them for their time. 2.3.4. Ethical Considerations Survivors completed the baseline survey in approximately 45 min. Each received a $15-dollar gift card for their time and resources on health-related topics, including violence. Trained research assistants conducted all of the data collection procedures after completing a comprehensive four-part training series. The Institutional Review Board of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health approved all methods, which were aligned with ethical best practices for violence-related research [59]. 2.4.2. Covariates Categorical demographic characteristics include age, race/ethnicity, education, and income. Past month employment was dichotomized to capture responses as affirmative or negative. An adapted measure for economic dependence on an abusive partner measured ten yes/no questions about things the participant may have depended on an intimate partner for in the past three months, such as food, transportation, and money [65]. A positive response to any question was considered economic dependence. A four-level variable assessed survivors’ ability to meet their financial needs independently, with assistance, partially with assistance, and not at all. This measure was developed by our community research partner as part of their Measuring Success Framework [66]. Food stress or insecurity was assessed using an adapted measure, “In the past three months, how often would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough money to buy food for yourself and your children?” [67] Similarly, recent housing insecurity was measured by, “In the past three months, how often would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough money to pay your rent or mortgage?” [67] Variables measuring trouble getting housing in the past three months and recent difficulty with a landlord measures were adapted from Rollins et al.’s Housing Instability Index [68] and assessed dichotomously. Investigator-developed measures assessed comfortability with proximity to family and friends (“I live close to family, friends, or other loved ones”) and the abuser (“I am comfortable that I live far enough away from (partner’s initials)”), dichotomized to no/not sure and yes based on ordinal responses of 1—strongly disagree to 5—strongly agree. A binary measure for home safety (“I feel safe at home”) and children in common with the abuser were recorded. Perception of personal IPV risk was assessed using, “What do you think the chances are that you will be pushed, shoved, or hit by a partner in the next three months?” (1—not at all likely to 5—very likely) and recategorized to likely, unsure, and not likely, an adaption from previous work in the field [69]. The Social Cohesion Scale [70] consisted of four items assessing agreement with statements like “People in my neighborhood can be trusted.” Responses ranged from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) and were scored by averaging all responses for survivors who had complete data on all items; recategorized as yes, no, neutral. Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89. Recent physical and sexual IPV was measured with five items from the physical and sexual subscales of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale [71], which asked about the frequency of behaviors such as pushed, shoved or slapped me and insisted on sex when I did not want to, from 0 (never) to 3 (5 or more times). A variable in the analysis captures recent IPV based on the report of partner violence one or more times in the past three months; Cronbach’s = 0.89. Additional measures of health symptoms, such as depression [72], PTSD [73], and past year access to health care if needed, were included."
Neighborhood Social Support and Social Participation as Predictors of Dating Violence,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36803309/,"Rodrigues, P., Hébert, M., & Philibert, M. (2023). Neighborhood Social Support and Social Participation as Predictors of Dating Violence. Journal of interpersonal violence, 38(13-14), 8400–8421. https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605231155130","Many adolescents experience violence in the context of dating and romantic relationships. Neighborhoods can influence dating violence by offering certain resources which can provide social support and opportunities for social participation, but knowledge about these effects is still limited. The purpose of the current study was to (a) assess the association between neighborhood social support, social participation, and dating violence, and (b) explore possible gender difference in these associations. This study was conducted on a subsample of 511 participants living in Montréal from the Québec Health Survey of High School Students (QHSHSS 2016-2017). QHSHSS data were used to measure psychological and physical/sexual violence (perpetration and victimization), neighborhood social support, and social participation, as well as individual and family covariates. Several neighborhood-level data from multiple sources were also used as covariates. Logistic regressions were performed to estimate associations between neighborhood social support and social participation, and Dating violence (DV). Analyses were conducted separately for girls and boys to explore possible gender differences. Findings suggest that girls who reported high neighborhood social support had a lower risk of perpetrating psychological DV. High social participation was associated with a lower risk of perpetrating physical/sexual DV for girls, whereas it was associated with a higher risk of perpetrating psychological DV for boys. Preventive strategies to foster social support in neighborhoods, such as mentoring programs, and the development of community organizations to increase the social participation of adolescents could help reduce DV. To address the perpetration of DV by boys, prevention programs in community and sports organizations targeting male peer groups should also be developed to prevent these behaviors.

","Four variables were used to assess DV: psychological DV victimization, psychological DV perpetration, physical/sexual DV victimization, and physical/sexual DV perpetration. Similar questions were used for victimization (e.g., “he/she . . . me”) and perpetration (“I . . . him/her”). Two items were used to measure psychological DV victimization (i.e., “He/she controlled my outings, my email conversations or cell phone; he/she prevented me from seeing my friends”/“He/she viciously criticized my physical appearance; he/she insulted me in front of people; he/she put me down”). Two other items measured psychological DV perpetration (i.e., “I criticized him/her viciously about his/her physical appearance; I insulted him/her in front of people; I put him/her down.”/“I criticized him/her viciously about his/her physical appearance; I insulted him/her in front of people; I put him/her down”). For these four items, participants were asked to indicate how often they had experienced each situation in the past 12 months using a 4-point Likert scale: “never,” “once,” “twice,” and “three or more times.” Dichotomous variables for victimization and perpetration were developed separately by distinguishing participants who reported never psychological DV perpetration/victimization from those who reported at least one of these situations. Four items from an adapted version of the Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus et al., 1996) were used to measure physical DV victimization (e.g., “He/she used his/her fists or feet, an object or a weapon to hurt me”) and perpetration (e.g., “I used my fists or feet, an object or a weapon to hurt him/her”). For sexual DV, two items were used for victimization (i.e., “He/she forced me to kiss or caress him/her when I didn’t want to” / “He/she forced me to have sexual contact or sexual intercourse when I didn’t want to”) and two other questions were used for perpetration (i.e., “I forced him/her to kiss or caress me when he/she didn’t want to” / “I forced him/her to have sexual contact or sexual intercourse with me when he/she didn’t want to”). Physical and sexual DV were assessed jointly because the number of participants who reported perpetrating sexual violence was relatively low. Similar to the psychological measures of DV, two dichotomous variables (victimization and perpetration) were developed to differentiate participants who had experienced at least one physical/sexual DV event in the past 12 months from those who reported never having experienced one. Neighborhood social support and social participation Neighborhood social support was measured using six questions inspired by the California Healthy Kids Survey (Austin et al., 2013). For each question, participants were asked to think about situations that might occur outside their school or home, such as in their neighborhood. The statements assessed the adolescents’ perception of their relationships with adults outside the home and school (e.g., “Outside of my home and school, there is an adult who really cares about me”). Four response options were available, ranging from 1 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Very much”). The scores on the six variables were averaged and dichotomized: low social support (average score below 3) and high social support (average score above 3). Internal consistency was excellent (α = .96). Social participation was assessed using three questions describing the respondent’s perception of their involvement in community life and their ability to participate in activities (e.g., “Outside of my home and school, I am part of clubs, sports teams, church/temple or other group activities”). The response options ranged from 1 (“Not at all”) to 4 (“Very much”). Average scores of the three statements were dichotomized to distinguish participants with low social participation (average score below 3) from those with high social participation (average score above 3). Internal consistency was acceptable (α = .72). Covariates Adjustment variables were selected using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). DAGs are graphical representations of causal relationships between exposures and a given outcome (Pearl, 1995; Schisterman et al., 2009). They are powerful tools that can be used to identify confounders and reduce the risk of overadjustment (Schisterman et al., 2009). The DAG led to identifying potential confounders at both individual and neighborhood levels. Five variables were used as covariates at the individual level: gender (girl or boy), high school grade level (Grade 7 or 8, 9, 10, and 11), the highest level of parental education (high school or less, college or professional training, university), family structure (two parents, blended family or shared custody, living with one parent or other family structure), and parental country of birth (two parents born in Canada, at least one parent born outside Canada). Several neighborhood-level factors were also identified as potential confounders, describing sociodemographic, physical, and social characteristics associated with DV (Rodrigues et al., 2022): socioeconomic status, single parenthood, residential instability, ethnocultural diversity, greenness, walkability, criminality, density of green spaces, and density of alcohol outlets (on-premises and off-premises). These neighborhood-level variables were operationalized using buffers around the participants’ place of residence (i.e., postal code of participants). Since the effect of these factors is sensitive to the spatial scale of analysis, four distances were used to obtain these buffers: 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 m. Prior analyses were conducted to identify the most appropriate scale for each factor and outcome separately using the models’ fit. Details of the operationalization of neighborhoods’ characteristics are available elsewhere (Rodrigues et al., 2022)."

American journal of public health, 103(4), 657–664. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2012.300927","Objectives: We examined the relationship between alcohol outlets, drug markets (approximated by arrests for possession and trafficking), and violence in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2006. We analyzed geographic and environmental versus individual factors related to violence and identified areas high in violent crime. Methods: We used data from the Boston Police Department, US Census, and Massachusetts State Alcohol Beverage Control Commission. Spatial modeling was employed at the block group level, and violent crime, alcohol outlets, and drug markets were mapped. Results: Relative to other block groups, block groups in the highest decile of violent crime (n = 55) were found to be poorer (e.g., lower incomes, higher percentages of vacant homes), and they had greater numbers of alcohol outlets and higher drug arrest rates. Alcohol outlets and drug possession and trafficking arrests were predictive of violent crime. Also, spatial effects resulting from neighboring block groups were related to violent crime. Both alcohol outlet density and type were associated with violent crime in a differentiated and complex way. Conclusions: With drug possession and trafficking arrests as a proxy for drug markets, spatial relationships between alcohol outlets and violence were found in addition to typical sociodemographic predictors.","We derived our data from 3 sources: Boston Police Department (BPD) data from 2006 on homicides and aggravated assault incidents, drug arrests, and 911 citizen emergency calls for service; 2000 US Census data, including population estimates; and 2009 alcohol outlet data from the Massachusetts Alcohol Beverage Control Commission. Our outcome of interest was the number of violent crimes (homicide, robbery, aggravated assault) occurring in each census block group in 2006. We combined them into a single violent crime measure. Although the distribution of violent crime counts was skewed toward zero, the Poisson modeling used in this analysis did not require normality. These data were geocoded to the address level and then aggregated up to the census block group. In compiling official data on aggravated assaults and homicides, BPD follows Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime Report standards. These data include information on type of violent assault, specific location of the assault, and the time and date of the assault. Figure 1 displays violent crime densities along with alcohol outlet and drug arrest densities (ArcGIS19 was used in creating the maps in Figure 1). Forcible rape was not included in the data set because, owing to privacy considerations, the geographic level needed for our analysis was not available. In line with the existing ecological literature, we used a broad spectrum of census-based information to characterize neighborhood structures at the census block group level. Ten variables pertaining to neighborhood structural characteristics were extracted from the 2000 census to broadly represent poverty, affluence, residential stability, age structure, family disruption, and racial composition. The 2 variables describing poverty were the percentage of households with incomes below $25 000 per year and the percentage of unemployed individuals in the civil labor force. The 2 variables capturing affluence were the percentage of households with incomes above $75 000 per year and the percentage of adults with an associate degree or higher. The 2 variables measuring residential stability were the percentage of occupied housing units that are occupied by renters and the percentage of vacant housing units. The 2 variables measuring age structure were the percentage of the population aged 16 years and younger and the percentage of the population aged 65 years and older. Finally, family disruption was defined as the percentage of female-headed families, and racial composition was defined as the percentage of the population within the census block group that was non-White. Alcohol Outlet Density Data on alcohol outlet locations (obtained from the Massachusetts Alcohol Beverage Control Commission) in 2006 were geocoded to the street address of the establishment. Of the 1232 alcohol outlet license records, 2 had no address and 11 included a street name but no building number. Of the remaining 1219 records, 1086 addresses were geocoded, for an overall geocoding matching rate of 89%. Among all licenses registered in the city of Boston, 29 alcohol outlets fell outside of Boston’s city limit or were located at Boston’s Logan International Airport. The census block group containing Logan International Airport was not included because the area consists mostly of airport facilities, which have a different security and population structure than the rest of the study area. Thus, of the 1086 alcohol outlets geocoded, 1057 fell in the 544 census blocks that formed the study area. The number of alcohol outlets by census block group was tabulated for restaurants that sold only wine and malt alcohol (n = 480), restaurants that sold all types of alcohol (n = 286), package alcohol outlets (n = 182), and all other types of outlets (n = 109; Figure 1)."
Community correlates of change: A mixed-effects assessment of shooting dynamics during COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35196358/,"Johnson, N. J., & Roman, C. G. (2022). Community correlates of change: A mixed-effects assessment of shooting dynamics during COVID-19. PloS one, 17(2), e0263777. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263777",,"The site of this study is Philadelphia, PA, a city in the northeastern United States with a population of roughly 1.5 million people [55]. The city is racially and ethnically diverse, with a nearly equal percentage of Black and white residents (42.1% and 40.7%, respectively) and significant Hispanic or Latino population (14.7%). An estimated quarter of Philadelphia residents speak a language other than English at home. Philadelphia often ranks higher than the national average on measures of poverty. According to the 2019 American Community Survey 5-year estimates, the median household income in Philadelphia was almost $46,000, compared to $68,700 nationwide. Similarly, the percent of Philadelphians in poverty was estimated at more than 24%, compared to 10.5% in the country as a whole. As the focus of this research is on neighborhood-level change, census tracts were used as the spatial unit of analysis to approximate Philadelphia neighborhoods. Census tracts are often used in neighborhood-level research because they are generally stable over time, and because they facilitate the aggregation of census data to each unit with ease. This study uses the 2010 Philadelphia census tract boundaries, which were obtained via the Open Data Philly data portal (see S1 Table for data sources). Out of the original 384 census tracts, seven were removed from the analysis due to having a population of zero, according to the 2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. A further four tracts were removed from the analysis because they were comprised entirely of major parks, leaving a final sample size of 373 census tracts. The average size of a Philadelphia census tract is roughly 0.35 square miles, with an average residential population of 4,220 people. Because shootings are not a frequent occurrence, even in the highest crime neighborhoods, the detection of weekly or even monthly changes in shootings is very difficult. Therefore, the temporal units used in the study are bimonthly units. The study time period extends from January 2017 through June 2021, resulting in 27 time points. As described more fully in the analytic approach section, the final analytical dataset nested the 27 time points within 373 census tracts, resulting in 10,071 observations. Dependent variable The outcome of interest in the study is the number of shootings occurring per bimonthly period, where shootings refer to shooting victims. Shooting data for Philadelphia were obtained via the Open Data Philly data portal. These data are publicly released by the Philadelphia Police Department daily, and contain both criminal and officer-involved shootings. For this research, shooting victim data were downloaded as a shapefile and imported into ArcGIS Pro 2.6.0 for aggregation to the Philadelphia census tracts. After the removal of officer-involved shootings, the shapefile included a total of 8,122 shootings occurring between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2021. 96% of shootings were geocoded to a Philadelphia street block or intersection and joined with a Philadelphia census tract, exceeding minimum acceptable thresholds [56, 57]. Once each shooting was connected to a census tract, the resulting data file was imported to R, where it was collapsed into total counts of shootings per tract, per bimonthly period.
Independent variables Structural predictors. Measures were included in the analyses that aimed to capture the role that neighborhood structure plays in differences in the evolution of shootings over time. Indicators of social disorganization have taken many forms in communities and crime research. This study included measures of concentrated disadvantage, residential instability and an index reflecting the foreign-born population to capture measures of social disorganization [32, 33, 41]. Concentrated disadvantage was measured as the average of four z-scored census items: the percent of the population in poverty, in female headed households, unemployed, and the percent of households receiving public assistance (Cronbach’s α = 0.85). These items, along with all other variables used to construct the structural indicators, were obtained from the 2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Residential instability was measured as the percentage of renter-occupied households within the census tract. The foreign-born index was created as the average of the z-scores of the percent foreign born population and percent of the population reporting that they spoke a language at home other than English (Cronbach’s α = 0.84). An ethno-racial heterogeneity index was also created for inclusion into the statistical models, yet this variable correlated highly with the majority Black variable described below, and was thus excluded from all models.
Finally, a variable measuring whether a neighborhood was more than 70% Black (PK Black) was included as a dichotomous predictor of shootings when COVID-19 began and its change over time. Peterson and Krivo [35] used 70% as a threshold for defining the ethnoracial makeup of census tracts. This variable was included as a theoretical predictor that reflected the residual risk of gun violence victimization above and beyond economic disadvantage that has been documented in prior research [e.g. 37, 40]. To further aid the interpretation of model coefficients, the concentrated disadvantage, foreign-born, and instability indices were z-scored prior to inclusion in the models.

Drug markets. Supply- and demand-side pressures for illicit narcotics could have theoretically influenced the interactions among drug trade organizations and between sellers and buyers, potentially altering the landscape for violence in neighborhoods with significant drug activity. However, it is difficult to know for certain what effect COVID-19 has had on drug markets [58]. To test whether high drug market activity predicted changes in shooting rates after the pandemic began, an indicator of whether a neighborhood experienced a high rate of drug arrests (drug sales and possession) between 2017 and the end of 2019 was included in the models. Due to shifts in arrest policy at the Philadelphia Police Department, drug arrests made in 2020 were not included in the determination of tracts with high drug market activity. Drug arrest counts collapsed to the census tract were provided by the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office. The drug market measure was dichotomized due to extreme skew (skewness = 8.99), as drug activity is highly concentrated. The measure was created by first rating the pooled number of drug arrests for 2017–2019 per 1,000 population for each census tract, then assigning the tracts falling above the 90th percentile of this distribution a value of one, and to the rest a value of zero. Drug arrests have been used to estimate drug markets in prior work [59–61]. The tracts identified as having high-drug activity through this process corresponded closely with previously identified drug markets in Philadelphia [62]. Furthermore, erring on the side of choosing a higher percentile (rather than lower) ensures that the measure is capturing those spaces that have very active drug markets.

Distance to drug markets. As stated previously, drug markets are an example of a “crime attractor” in environmental criminology, whereby the area serves as an attractor point for illicit activity, as users and sellers go about their routine activities [12, 63]. It was expected that neighborhoods with active drug markets would have relatively higher shooting rates than those without, and likewise, that neighborhoods located closer to drug markets would exhibit more gun violence than those situated further away. Neighborhoods in closer proximity to drug markets may experience more shootings as individuals affiliated with the illicit drug trade traverse neighborhood boundaries during their routine activities, or if norms regarding violence and gun carrying spillover to nearby areas [64]. To create a distance to drug markets measure, the Euclidean distance in miles was calculated between the centroid of each census tract in Philadelphia to the centroid of each of the drug market tracts identified in the previous section. The total distance in miles was then summed for each tract, reflecting a total distance from all identified drug markets. Tracts with larger distances were located further away from all drug markets, while those with smaller distances were located closer to all drug markets. The measure was z-scored prior to inclusion in the models."

Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research, 15(4), 437–447. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-013-0374-x","Predictive epidemiology is an embryonic field that involves developing informative signatures for disorder and tracking them using surveillance methods. Through such efforts assistance can be provided to the planning and implementation of preventive interventions. Believing that certain minor crimes indicative of gang activity are informative signatures for the emergence of serious youth violence in communities, in this study we aim to predict outbreaks of violence in neighborhoods from pre-existing levels and changes in reports of minor offenses. We develop a prediction equation that uses publicly available neighborhood-level data on disorderly conduct, vandalism, and weapons violations to predict neighborhoods likely to have increases in serious violent crime. Data for this study were taken from the Chicago Police Department ClearMap reporting system, which provided data on index and non-index crimes for each of the 844 Chicago census tracts. Data were available in three month segments for a single year (fall 2009, winter, spring, and summer 2010). Predicted change in aggravated battery and overall violent crime correlated significantly with actual change. The model was evaluated by comparing alternative models using randomly selected training and test samples, producing favorable results with reference to overfitting, seasonal variation, and spatial autocorrelation. A prediction equation based on winter and spring levels of the predictors had area under the curve ranging from .65 to .71 for aggravated battery, and .58 to .69 for overall violent crime. We discuss future development of such a model and its potential usefulness in violence prevention and community policing.","For each census tract and each 3-month segment, we obtained numbers of reports of three outcome variables and three predictors. Outcomes Aggravated battery, defined as “an unlawful attack by one person upon another wherein the offender uses a weapon or the victim suffers obvious severe or aggravated bodily injury involving apparent broken bones, loss of teeth, possible internal injury, severe laceration, or loss of consciousness” included Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Codes for battery with a handgun (041A) and with a knife or other cutting instrument (0552), among others. Violent Crime was a composite that included Homicide and Aggravated Battery plus Criminal Sexual Assault (UCR Codes 0261–0272), Robbery (UCR Codes 031A-033B), and Aggravated Assault (UCR Codes 051A-0551; Chicago Police Department, 2010a). Predictors Vandalism, defined as “willfully or maliciously destroying, damaging, defacing, or otherwise injuring real or personal property without the consent of the owner or the person having custody or control of it,” included 5 UCR codes, including Criminal Damage to Property (1310) and Criminal Damage to Vehicle (1320). Weapons violations, defined as “the violation of laws or ordinances prohibiting the manufacture, sale, purchase, transportation, possession, concealment, or use of firearms, cutting instruments, explosives, incendiary devices, or other deadly weapons,” included 16 UCR codes, including Unlawful Use of a Handgun (0141) and Possession of a Firearm at a School (1435). Disorderly conduct, defined as “any behavior that tends to disturb the public peace or decorum, scandalize the community, or shock the public sense of morality,” included 13 UCR codes, including Reckless Conduct (0470) and Mob Action (3100). Covariates The covariates were taken from the 2005–2009 American Community Survey estimates (United States Census Bureau 2010). Concentrated poverty was the percent below the poverty level for each tract and ethnic composition was the percent African-American for each tract. Data Analysis Our analysis plan involved three phases: development, evaluation, and prediction. Development First, we developed a prediction equation using fall–winter–spring data at the census tract level. The outcome variable was the winter–spring difference score, and the predictors were winter levels of the outcome, and fall and winter scores of the predictors. Having fit the model, we then used the unstandardized parameters to predict summer levels of each outcome from winter levels and spring–winter change in the predictors (vandalism, weapons violations, and disorderly conduct)."
Classifying crime places by neighborhood visual appearance and police geonarratives: a machine learning approach,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33718652/,"Amiruzzaman, M., Curtis, A., Zhao, Y., Jamonnak, S., & Ye, X.

Journal of computational social science, 4(2), 813–837. https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-021-00107-x","The complex interrelationship between the built environment and social problems is often described but frequently lacks the data and analytical framework to explore the potential of such a relationship in different applications. We address this gap using a machine learning (ML) approach to study whether street-level built environment visuals can be used to classify locations with high-crime and lower-crime activities. For training the ML model, spatialized expert narratives are used to label different locations. Semantic categories (e.g., road, sky, greenery, etc.) are extracted from Google Street View (GSV) images of those locations through a deep learning image segmentation algorithm. From these, local visual representatives are generated and used to train the classification model. The model is applied to two cities in the U.S. to predict the locations as being linked to high crime. Results show our model can predict high- and lower-crime areas with high accuracies (above 98% and 95% in first and second test cities, accordingly).","We used sentiment analysis to determine high- and lower-crime area related sentences. Sentiment analysis is a process to identify positive and negative sentences using text-mining [14]. In this study, positive sentences are those that are not related to crime, and negative sentences are those related to either violent or property crime. The bag-of-words is a popular text-mining approach to understand the sentiment of a sentence [90]. In this study, the keywords, such as murder, robbery, gun, drugs, and assault (and their variations for example robberies) are used to identify negative sentences, and beautiful, amazing, happy, and family are used to identify positive sentences. A frequency count of positive and negative words was calculated to classify sentences from the geonarrative data. We checked each sentence manually for its rightful category. Because keywords alone do not fully capture an event, to increase accuracy, we manually analyzed those sentences so that they could be classified into high- or lower- crime categories. In the manual analysis, two researchers independently analyzed the result and then discussed on disputed categories and finalized the categorization after an agreement. We discarded neutral sentences (i.e., not related to places) from further analysis. From these, a classification model was trained and tested using a three-step approach to gauge effectiveness and limitations. The results are reported and discussed in “Experiment results and discussion” section. Step 1: Several supervised ML algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (FR), and Naive Bayes (NB) were trained to recognize high-crime or lower-crime PCOIs in the imagery. About 𝑛=400 PCOIs were labeled for the test city, of which 80% were used to train the model, and 20% to validate the classification results. In particular, three comparison experiments were performed with different model inputs: Using different location representatives as discussed in “SVD method” section, in order to identify a lower level of crime severity using only the visual characterization of the neighborhood. Using the neighborhood representatives versus using only the image segmentation vector at the exact location 𝑃𝑖, in order to justify our approach of using street-level appearance in a neighborhood. Using the full 19-dimension representative vectors versus using different combinations of the semantic dimensions, in order to find essential categories linked to linking to tendency of crimes and drug uses. Step 2: The trained model is applied in another city, approximately 20 miles from the original test environment (i.e., City 1). To evaluate the classification accuracy, locations in this second city (i.e., City 2) are labeled as being high-crime/lower-crime from a police report dataset. The report included both crime and the location of the crime. Using the FBI crime severity, we labeled places as high-crime and lower-crime (Fig. ​(Fig.44). Step 3: To assess global transferability the trained model is tested on a varying set of different urban environments from across the US. These locations are labelled based on their crime indexes and then used to evaluate the model’s effectiveness as the region changes. To verify our findings and model accuracy, we downloaded the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI’s) Uniform Crime Report (UCR) from their official website. Following the guidelines provided by Douglas, Burgess, Burgess, and Ressler [29], we grouped crime incidents information into two categories: violent crime and property crime. We used the UCR data to calculate the crime scores. In this study, we considered criminal activities such as, (a) violent crime (murder, rape, robbery, assault), and (b) property crime (burglary, theft, vehicle theft). We divided the number of criminal activities by their respective population to get the crime rate for each type of criminal activity separately, then we normalized the crime rate for 100 residents, this was done so that we can compare crime scores of neighborhoods. All crime types should not be considered the same based [9] so violent crime are weighted differently to property crime. We assigned these “seriousness weights” to the FBI UCR data, and noticed that the average value for violent crimes is three times that of property crimes. Hence, considering the nature and severity of the crime in the crime score calculation we multiplied violent crime by 0.75 and property crime by 0.25, i.e.,"

The spatial effects of 311 calls in adjacent areas on drug violations, property crime, and violence in a focal neighborhood are also observed. In contrast, official reports of physical disorder, captured with code violation, is either weakly related to crime or lacking an empirical relationship. Conclusion Overall, our findings suggest that the association between physical disorder and neighborhood crimes is robust over time. In addition, this association is conditioned by how physical disorder is operationalized, with dimensions such as residential report and official report of physical disorder playing a unique, and occasionally important role in understanding overall patterns of neighborhood criminal activity.","Our statistical analysis combines four administrative and official databases to analyze patterns of crime occurring each month in New Orleans, LA, between April 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2018. These data capture patterns of crime, demographics, code violations, and resident calls to the 311 system in New Orleans. 1 The date range reflects the joint availability of the major sources of information we use to build our sample. Our unit of analysis is the block group by month. Block groups are smallest level of geographic aggregation for which data are available on several of our focal variables. While prior research (e.g., Wheeler 2018) has used micro-areas to analyze crime and disorder, we view block groups as micro-social units of aggregation, as they are smaller than more meso-level areal units such as census tracts or ZIP codes. As a result, our research is applicable to relatively small local areas and their immediate surrounding contexts which is not possible for larger geographic units. We organize our data in a panel structure that is updated monthly, harmonizing the databases described below by using GIS techniques to link our variables to specific block groups and time points. Our research design ultimately yields a sample size of 40,176, based on the combination of 81 months and 496 block groups."
"Community violence and academic achievement: High-crime neighborhoods, hotspot streets, and the geographic scale of ""community""",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34758040/,"Numerous studies have demonstrated a negative relationship between community violence and youth academic achievement, but they have varied in their geographic definition of ""community,"" especially as it relates to proximity to students' residences. We extend this by considering the independent relationships between academic achievement and violent events (from 911 dispatches; e.g., gun shots) at the neighborhood (i.e., census tract) and street-block levels. We use data from standardized Math and English Language Arts (ELA) tests from Boston, MA for 2011-2013. Exposure to community violence was partially independent between streets and tracts, with some students living on low-crime streets in high-crime neighborhoods or high-crime streets in low-crime neighborhoods. Initial regression models found that differences in a neighborhood's violent crime predicted up to a 3% difference in test scores on both Math and ELA tests. Students living on high-crime streets scored an additional 1% lower than neighbors on safer streets. Subsequent models with student-level fixed effects, however, eliminated these relationships, except for the effect of neighborhood-level violence on Math scores. These findings suggest that future work should consider community violence at both geographic scales, but that in this case the impacts were only consistent at the neighborhood level and associations at the street level were seemingly due to spatial segregation of households.",,"The research was approved by Northeastern University’s Institutional Review Board and permitted by the Boston Public Schools as it analyzed student administrative records. BPS provided student scores on standardized tests from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) for 2011–2012, 2012–2013, and 2013–2014. Students take MCAS tests in grades 3–8 and 10, receiving separate scores for Math and ELA, each on an 80-point scale (range: 200–280). Although these tests differ according to grade level, they are explicitly intended to track growth in these basic skills and are used in this way by the state and districts (see https://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/growth/). The records also included student sex, race, poverty status (i.e., living under 185% of the poverty level, thereby qualifying for either free or reduced-price meals), English Language Learner status (current, former, or never), and enrollment in any Special Education programs (e.g., cognitive limitations, behavior problems, physical disability; dichotomous variable with 1 = enrolled in special education). The system utilizes a standardized list of case types to categorize all requests at the time of receipt. Previous work with these data used factor analysis to develop groupings of case types that act as indices of disorder and crime [44, 45]. We combined three indices of violence: private conflict arising from personal relationships (e.g., domestic violence); public violence that did not involve a gun (e.g., fight); and prevalence of guns, as indicated by shootings or other incidents involving guns. More detail on the case types included in each of these three measures and their frequencies are reported in the S1 File. Over the three years, there were 99,213 dispatches falling into one of these three categories, 96% of which were geocoded. This subset was used to calculate levels of violence for street segments, and all events were used to calculate tract violence levels."
Event-level prediction of urban crime reveals a signature of enforcement bias in US cities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35773401/,"Rotaru, V., Huang, Y., Li, T., Evans, J., & Chattopadhyay, I. (2022). Event-level prediction of urban crime reveals a signature of enforcement bias in US cities. Nature human behaviour, 6(8), 1056–1068. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01372-0","Policing efforts to thwart crime typically rely on criminal infraction reports, which implicitly manifest a complex relationship between crime, policing and society. As a result, crime prediction and predictive policing have stirred controversy, with the latest artificial intelligence-based algorithms producing limited insight into the social system of crime. Here we show that, while predictive models may enhance state power through criminal surveillance, they also enable surveillance of the state by tracing systemic biases in crime enforcement. We introduce a stochastic inference algorithm that forecasts crime by learning spatio-temporal dependencies from event reports, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ~90% in Chicago for crimes predicted per week within ~1,000 ft. Such predictions enable us to study perturbations of crime patterns that suggest that the response to increased crime is biased by neighbourhood socio-economic status, draining policy resources from socio-economically disadvantaged areas, as demonstrated in eight major US cities.","The sources of crime incidence data used in this study for the different US cities are enumerated in Table 1. These logs include spatio-temporal event localization along with the nature, category and a brief description of the recorded incident. For the City of Chicago, we also have access to the number of arrests made during or as a result of each event. For Chicago, the log is updated daily, keeping current with a lag of 7 days, and we make predictions for each of the years 2014–2017 (using three years before the target year for model inference and one year for out-of-sample validation) for the prediction results shown in Fig. 1. The evolving nature of the urban scenescape48 necessitates that we restrict the modelling window to a few years at a time. The length of this window is decided by trading off the loss of performance from shorter data streams to ignoring the evolution of the underlying generative processes with longer streams. The training and testing periods of the other cities are presented in Table 1. In this study, we consider two broad categories of criminal infractions: violent crimes consisting of homicides, assault, battery, etc. and property crimes consisting of burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, etc. Drug crimes are excluded from our consideration due to the possibility of ambiguity in the use of violence and the potential for biased documentation of such events. For the City of Chicago, the number of individuals arrested during each recorded event is considered as a separate variable to be modelled and predicted, which allows us to investigate the possibility of enforcement biases in subsequent perturbation analyses. We also use data on socio-economic variables available at the portal corresponding to Chicago community areas and census tracts, including the percentage of population living in crowded housing, those residing below the poverty line, those unemployed at various age groups, per capita income and the urban hardship index49. Such data are also obtained from the City of Chicago data portal. Additionally, we use data on poverty estimates for the other cities, which are obtained from https://www-census-gov.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca. The degree of directed predictive dependency between one variable (the source stream) on another (the target stream), also called the (Granger-)causal influence, is quantified by the coefficient of dependence (γ; Supplementary Methods). Identifying the source–target pairs for which the coefficient of dependency (or Granger causality) is high (Extended Data Fig. 6), we note that there exists a sparse set of spatial tiles that exert nearly all of the directed dependency in the entire set of observed variables. Thus, observing these variables alone would enable us to make good event forecasts. These tiles span the expanse of the city, and a Voronoi decomposition based on the centres of these tiles in shown in Extended Data Fig. 6b. Such a decomposition demonstrates an algorithmic approach to choosing optimal neighbourhoods for urban analysis."

Researchers have begun to examine physical and social neighborhood risk factors of IPV, often using cross-sectional data. Most studies focus on risk or promotive factors. Often, neighborhood factors are studied through the lens of social disorganization theory, which focuses on how a neighborhood slips into a violent and crime-ridden place. Busy streets theory provides an alternative perspective, focusing on how building up community assets and resources may help create a safe and vibrant neighborhood. A conceptual approach that utilizes risk and promotive neighborhood variables may help develop new conceptual frameworks for understanding how context may decrease risk for, or moderate, the negative consequences of IPV. Using five waves of data from a 24-year longitudinal study, we employ multilevel linear regression models to examine the trajectory of IPV experiences in relation to positive perceptions of neighborhood, neighborhood cohesion, and informal social control in individuals aged 28 to 33 years. We control for the neighborhood and individual-level risk factors of alcohol consumption, drug use, observed neighborhood violence, and demographic factors of age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status. We found that positive perceptions of neighborhood, alcohol consumption, drug use, economic need, and observed neighborhood violence are associated with IPV. Levels of IPV risk were relatively constant within individuals across waves, but varied significantly between individuals. The measure of positive perceptions of neighborhood is derived from busy streets theory, which may be a useful conceptual framework for understanding how neighborhoods may contribute to positive social contexts that can protect residents from IPV experiences, and potentially other violent behavior. Additional research examining promotive social neighborhood features derived from busy streets theory may help expand our understanding of contextual factors that affect IPV."
Illegal Firearm Availability and Violence: Neighborhood-Level Analysis,,"Yu, S. V., Lee, D., & Pizarro, J. M. (2020). Illegal Firearm Availability and Violence: Neighborhood-Level Analysis. Journal of interpersonal violence, 35(19-20), 3986–4012. https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517712272","Violence involving firearms poses a serious threat to public safety in urban areas. The present study examines how illegal firearm availability (IFA) is related to firearm violence at the neighborhood level. We analyzed 3 years (from 2005 to 2007) of recovered firearm and violent index crime data from Newark, New Jersey. Violent index crime is separated into three categories by level of firearm use: shootings, display of firearm violence (DFV), and no-firearm violence (NFV). Negative binominal regression was conducted to examine the relationship between IFA and firearm violence at the neighborhood level while controlling for neighborhood conditions. Firearm violence is prevalent in Newark: over 90% of homicides and 47% of robberies were committed with a firearm. IFA is related to increased shootings and NFV, but not to DFV. IFA is a robust predictor of shootings in Newark, New Jersey. Neighborhood conditions influence IFA and firearm violence. IFA may reflect neighborhood distress level, given that areas with high IFA experience increased firearm violence as well as NFV. The local clustering of violent crime suggests placed-focused policing strategies aimed at removing firearms would aid in curbing serious firearm violence in urban neighborhoods.","The current study utilizes the Newark Police Department (NPD) crime data and the 2000 census data. Located in the state of New Jersey, Newark is a midsize city of approximately 277,000 residents. Once a major transportation and economic hub of the United States, Newark now suffers from high violent crime rates and other social structural problems. Census statistics indicate that approximately 25% of families were living below the poverty line in 2000 and 2010, which is much higher than the state average of 10% (USCB, 2015). The majority of Newark residents were ethnic minorities (51.9% Black and 29.5% Hispanic), and 15% of households in Newark were classified as linguistically isolated.1 About a quarter of Newark residents were foreign-born, or headed by a female householder with children. Approximately 52.7% of those aged 16 and older were in the labor force, and the unemployment rates were approximately 16% for both genders in 2000. A total of 42.1% of Newark residents had less than a high school education. Finally, more than 40% of housing units were occupied by renters who had moved in within the last 5 years, reflecting residential instability in the area. In addition, the city also faces issues related to violent crime. The FBI (2015c) reported that in 2013, the city had a violent crime rate of over 1,000 (1,264) per 100,000 residents. The homicide rate for the city in 2013 was a staggering 40 per 100,000 residents, almost 4 times higher than the national homicide rate. Property crimes are also pervasive. In 2013, the city experienced a property crime rate of 3,222 offenses per 100,000. Data and measures Data were compiled by the NPD as part of the Compstat effort from January 2005 to December 2007. We combined 3 years of crime data (2005, 2006, and 2007) for the analysis due to relatively rare occurrences of serious violent crime and the use of a small spatial unit. The NPD data set contained legal classifications of index crimes, firearms recovered, the date and time of incident, and weapon use. Measures There are largely two measures used in this study: IFA (number of firearms recovered by the police) and number of violent crimes (shootings, DFV, and NFV) at the census block group level. All data from NPD were then geocoded in ArcGIS 9.3. The overall geocoding score was 98.2%. NPD closely tracks and records confiscated or recovered firearms as a performance measure in the enforcement of quality-of-life policing strategies (personal communication, Newark city police officer, October 9, 2012). We utilize the number of recovered firearms by police as a measure of IFA because it is a reflection of available firearms on the street. The “recovered firearms” by police includes both illegal weapons possession as well as firearms confiscated for “safekeeping.” “Safekeeping” is a common police practice in which officers seize the gun out of concern for firearm violence (McGarrell et al., 2001; Sherman & Rogan, 1995). “Safekeeping” firearms are returned to the rightful owner upon application or destroyed if the rightful owner cannot be established. The reasons for “safekeeping” include preventing suicide, harm to others, or holding it until the alleged owner provides proof of ownership. There is no breakdown in the data about how many of the recovered firearms by NPD led to illegal weapons charges, requests to trace the firearms to other agencies, or returns to the rightful owners.2 The second set of variables captures the number of violent crimes recorded by NPD. We classified index violent crime based on three levels of firearm usage: Shootings (discharge of firearm), DFV, and NFV. Violent crimes where shots were fired were coded as shootings. Shootings include homicides and aggravated assaults. DFV includes crime incidents where a firearm was never discharged, but used to make a threat to obtain a victim’s compliance. These criminal incidents include where a victim reported seeing a gun or the offender implied that he was armed with a firearm by opening his jacket or showing a bulge on his person. DFV includes aggravated assaults (striking the victim with a gun) and armed (with firearm) robberies. Finally, we coded violent crimes where no firearm use was reported as NFV."

Injury epidemiology, 7(1), 20. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40621-020-00246-1","Background and objective Educational achievement, particularly among youth, may mitigate risk of exposure to violence and negative related health outcomes such as crime and gang activity. Few studies to date have examined relationships between education and youth homicide. The authors hypothesized association between educational achievement in grades 3 and 8 and youth homicide mortality. Methods Neighborhood-based, city-wide analysis was conducted of cross-sectional data regarding N = 55 neighborhoods in Baltimore, MD, extracted from Baltimore 2017 Neighborhood Health Profiles. Results Higher educational achievement (operationalized by reading proficiency) in third, but not eighth, grade was associated with reduced neighborhood youth homicide mortality rates in hierarchical linear regression, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors (ß = − 0.5082, p = 0.03), such that each 1.97% increase in proportion of students reading at an acceptable level was associated with one fewer neighborhood youth homicide per 100,000. Neighborhoods within the highest tertile of youth homicide mortality differed from those in the lowest tertile with fewer males (45% vs. 48%, p = 0.002), greater unemployment (17% vs. 8%, p < 0.001), familial poverty (35% vs. 16%, p < 0.001), and residents identifying as black or African-American (88% vs. 25%, p < 0.001). Causal mediation analysis demonstrated mediation effects of familial poverty and eighth grade educational achievement through third grade educational achievement (ACME = 0.151, p = 0.04; ACME = − 0.300, p = 0.03, respectively) with no significant direct effects. Conclusions Higher educational achievement (operationalized by reading proficiency) predicts reduced homicide mortality among Baltimore youth and appears to mediate effects of familial poverty on homicide mortality as well. This converges with literature highlighting the importance of education as a determinant of social capital and violence. Future policy-based interventions should target inequalities in educational achievement to mitigate homicide risk among youth in communities facing disparities in violent crime.

"Exploring violence: The role of neighborhood characteristics, alcohol outlets, and other micro-places",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31300078/,"Snowden A. J. (2019). Exploring violence: The role of neighborhood characteristics, alcohol outlets, and other micro-places. Social science research, 82, 181–194. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2019.04.018","This study explores the association between neighborhood characteristics, alcohol outlets, other micro-places, and neighborhood violence rates. Prior studies that examined the alcohol availability and violence associations suggested that alcohol outlets play an important role in violent outcomes, yet we know less about the larger environment in which alcohol outlets are located, including how the availability of other types of places that exist side by side with alcohol outlets in neighborhoods could influence the alcohol-violence relationships. I collected publicly available data on simple and aggravated assaults, neighborhood characteristics (concentrated disadvantage, concentrated immigration, residential stability, and ethnic heterogeneity), on- and off-premise outlets, and other micro-places (colleges and universities, primary and secondary schools, financial services, gas stations, hotels and motels, laundromats, parks and playgrounds, and rooming houses) and subsequently aggregated the data to Milwaukee, Wisconsin census block groups. I estimated spatially lagged regression models to test these associations and compared the results across the models. The findings show that some neighborhood characteristics and some micro-places are important predictors of neighborhood violence. Importantly, off-premise alcohol outlets have a consistently significant positive relationship with simple and aggravated assaults, even when the influence of the neighborhood characteristics and micro-places is accounted for in the models. This study contributes to the environmental criminology theories and alcohol availability theory by highlighting the importance of off-premise outlets as crime attractors and crime generators to explain violence.","Exploring violence: The role of neighborhood characteristics, alcohol outlets, and other micro-The research site for this study is Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee is the largest city in the state of Wisconsin, located in the mid-western United States. Milwaukee covers land area of 96.79 square miles and its population is 598,672 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Milwaukee is in many ways dissimilar than other towns and cities across the state of Wisconsin but faces similar challenges as other major urban American cities. For example, relative to the rest of the state, Milwaukee's racial/ethnic diversity is reflected in the following population statistics: 46.8% White (compared to 86.5% White population for the entire state), 39.3% African American (compared to 6.3% African American population for the entire state), 3.6% Asian (compared to 2.5% Asian population for the entire state), 6.1% Other (compared to 1.7% Other for the entire state), and 3.6% identifying with two or more races (compared to 2.1% identifying with two or more races for the entire state) (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Additionally, in Milwaukee 36.3% of the population are non-Hispanic or Latino Whites, and 18% are of Hispanic or Latino origin, and in Wisconsin 82.4% are non-Hispanic or Latino Whites, and 6.3% are of Hispanic or Latino origin (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). What appears to be a very diverse city has its own set of challenges, however, illustrated in Milwaukee's stark geographic segregation along racial/ethnic lines. In Milwaukee, the White population resides within the North Shore area located along Lake Michigan, the African American population lives north-west of the city center, the Hispanic or Latino population is predominantly found on the south side of the city, and the Asian population is found primarily in small pockets within the near north side of the city. So, while Milwaukee does have the numbers to suggest that it is a very diverse city, the city population is segregated along racial/ethnic lines. Importantly, racial/ethnic segregation is a common indicator of other challenges in the city, such as structural disadvantage and elevated crime rates. As described in detail in the Results section (Fig. 1, Fig. 2), it is clear that both violence and neighborhood disadvantage indicators seem to be geographically clustered in Milwaukee (Moran's I for aggravated assaults was 0.60, p = 0.00; Moran's I for simple assaults was 0.50, p = 0.00; Moran's I for concentrated disadvantage was 0.52, p = 0.00). Highest levels of violent crimes and greatest neighborhood disadvantage can be found in the north-west and the near south side of the city, suggesting a vital role that neighborhood characteristics seem to have in crimes occurring in Milwaukee. I obtained the data on independent variables from the U.S. Census Bureau, and the City of Milwaukee publicly available data source website. For this project, I queried the 2011–2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates data to obtain neighborhood characteristics to measure concentrated disadvantage, concentrated immigration, residential stability, ethnic heterogeneity, and population density.2 Subsequently, I analyzed the data for underlying latent structures and carried out principal component analysis to reduce multicollinearity and identify structural components, such as concentrated disadvantage, concentrated immigration, and residential stability. Concentrated disadvantage measure (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.74) included proportions of: households receiving SSI, households receiving public assistance income, population that is 16 years and over that is unemployed, households with income below poverty level, and single parent households that have children under the age of 18 living in them. Concentrated immigration measure (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.73) included proportions of: population that is foreign born and population that is of Hispanic or Latino origin. Residential stability measure (Cronbach's Alpha = 0.65) included proportions of: population that resided in same house 1 year ago and owner-occupied housing units. I calculated ethnic heterogeneity measure by using the Herfindahl index (Gibbs and Martin, 1962), and first calculating proportions of White, African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, and Other populations. Subsequently, each proportion was squared, the squared proportions were summed, and then subtracted from 1, with higher scores indicating a greater diversity in the neighborhood (Osgood and Chambers, 2000). I calculated population density as the number of individuals residing in each block group divided by the block group area size in square miles, to account for the likelihood of higher crime rates occurring in areas due to higher population numbers. Lastly, I also controlled for daytime population in a set of sensitivity analyses to control for the additional level of guardianship provided by having people out and about, and the results (available upon request) remained unchanged. In line with prior work in this area (see Stults and Hasbrouch, 2015), I calculated the measure for commuter-adjusted daytime population as: daytime population = resident population + workers working in city – workers living in city. I standardized all the neighborhood measures prior to analyses."

Comparing forms of neighborhood instability as predictors of violence in Richmond, VA. PloS one, 17(9), e0273718. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273718","Violence events tend to cluster together geospatially. Various features of communities and their residents have been highlighted as explanations for such clustering in the literature. One reliable correlate of violence is neighborhood instability. Research on neighborhood instability indicates that such instability can be measured as property tax delinquency, yet no known work has contrasted external and internal sources of instability in predicting neighborhood violence. To this end we collected data on violence events, company and personal property tax delinquency, population density, race, income, food stamps, and alcohol outlets for each of Richmond, Virginia's 148 neighborhoods. We constructed and compared ordinary least-squares (OLS) to geographically weighted regression (GWR) models before constructing a final algorithm-selected GWR model. Our results indicated that the tax delinquency of company-owned properties (e.g., rental homes, apartments) was the only variable in our model (R2 = 0.62) that was associated with violence in all but four Richmond neighborhoods. We replicated this analysis using violence data from a later point in time which yielded largely identical results. These findings indicate that external sources of neighborhood instability may be more important to predicting violence than internal sources. Our results further provide support for social disorganization theory and point to opportunities to expand this framework.","Ethics statement All data collected for the current investigation comprised publicly available archival data and thus no ethics approval was sought for these variables. However, our final violence index variable did contain data obtained from records from Virginia Commonwealth University Health’s emergency department. Consent was waived (i.e., not directly obtained) for the collection of these data and the protocol utilized was given ethics review and approval by the institutional review board at Virginia Commonwealth University (protocol: HM13846). Data acquisition Tax delinquency Tax delinquency data were obtained from the City of Richmond’s Open Data repository website (https://data.richmondgov.com/). The tax delinquency reports generated by the City of Richmond contain information regarding the owner of the property, the amount in delinquency, the address of the property, and the geospatial coordinates (i.e., longitude and latitude) for each property. Properties in the original dataset comprised those that were in delinquent tax status for six months or more at the time of our initial query (6/30/2021). We then created two variables on the basis of the type of property: those owned by companies and those owned by private individuals prior to preprocessing. Neighborhood regions Richmond neighborhoods were determined based on the city’s publicly available neighborhood dataset and shapefile (https://data.richmondgov.com/). At the time of this study the city of Richmond officially recognized 148 neighborhoods.  A clear picture emerges from this research: low-income and otherwise underserved communities are at the highest risk for being exposed to violence in some way [4]. In the current work we drew from social disorganization theory to examine the impact of various geospatial features on neighborhood-level violence data from Richmond, VA."

International journal of environmental research and public health, 17(24), 9283. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249283","This paper presents an empirically grounded call for a more nuanced engagement and situatedness with placial characteristics within a spatial epidemiology frame. By using qualitative data collected through interviews and observation to parameterise standard and spatial regression models, and through a critical interpretation of their results, we present initial inroads for a situated spatial epidemiology and an analytical framework for health/medical geographers to iteratively engage with data, modelling, and the context of both the subject and process of analysis. In this study, we explore the socioeconomic factors that influence homicide rates in the Brazilian state of Alagoas from a critical public health perspective. Informed by field observation and interviews with 24 youths in low-income neighbourhoods and prisons in Alagoas, we derive and critically reflect on three regression models to predict municipal homicide rates from 2016-2020. The model results indicate significant effects for the male population, persons without elementary school completion, households with reported income, divorced persons, households without piped water, and persons working outside their home municipality. These results are situated in the broader socioeconomic context, trajectories, and cycles of inequality in the study area and underscore the need for integrative and contextually engaged mixed method study design in spatial epidemiology.","The empirical methods for this analysis were conducted in three phases: (i) a snowball review of the studies on violence and socioeconomic deprivation was conducted and qualitative data were collected via transcribed interviews and participant/field observation; (ii) based on the results of the first phase, we selected candidate variables from the Brazilian census and acquired homicide data at the municipal scale in Alagoas. These variables were entered into an aspatial linear regression model, a spatial lag model, and a spatial error model to identify socioeconomic correlates with homicide rates, and (iii) model results were contextualised using local expert knowledge and interview/observation findings. 2.1. Qualitative Data A snowball literature review was conducted from September 2019 until April 2020, during which academic and non-academic sources in English and Portuguese were collected and assessed for their thematic suitability. A total of 171 sources were indexed. Contextual information specific to Brazil, Alagoas, interpersonal violence, homicide, and socioeconomic/built environments was recorded and categorised heuristically to derive (a) an adequate depth of background information to the point of saturation and (b) a list of candidate socioeconomic criteria suitable for modelling homicide rates in the study area. Interview data and participant/field observation were drawn from fieldwork conducted by the second author in Alagoas during two data collection periods in 2013 and 2016, during which time the author conducted site/participant observation and 24 semi-structured interviews with local youths involved in violence and additional interviews and discussions with their family and community members, persons employed in the legal system, and other experts and community stakeholders. All participants provided informed consent and were anonymised for transcription. Data were collected in low-income communities across Macieó, in all correctional facilities for youths and adults in Macieó, and whilst travelling through the city with youths and community members. Following data collection, interviews were transcribed using 129 subject-derived codes and analysed using the QDA software package, and field observations/photographs were categorised and used to supplement and contextualise the results of the qualitative analysis. More detail on the data collection and analysis is provided by Moura de Souza [13]. 2.2. Quantitative Data Homicide data from January 2016 to February 2020 (inclusive) for every municipality in Alagoas (n = 101 during the study period) were acquired from the publicly accessible data portal of the Public Security Secretariat of the State of Alagoas (SESP). All recorded homicide records were downloaded with victim age, sex, date and time of death, municipality of residence, and cause of death (by ICD-10 group). Homicides were considered to be all cases with ICD codes X85–Y09 inclusive. The number of homicides was recalculated into an average crude rate per 100,000 life-years, based on each municipality’s number of homicides and its official estimated population for each year in the study period. Socioeconomic data for each municipality in the 2010 Brazil Census were acquired from the publicly accessible database provided by the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the federal agency responsible for the decennary national census. A total of 167 census indicators across all socioeconomic categories were collected and random samples were drawn and checked for errors against figures published by IBGE to ensure data fidelity; no data for the selected indicators were missing or featured erroneous or implausible values. Variables were thematically categorised manually (e.g., income measures, education, household amenities) and each category was examined and deliberated independent of the others. The deliberation phase was conducted amongst the authorship through eleven meetings and frequent informal discussions from February to August 2020, during which each category of interest was discussed in the context of the qualitative data, and linkages to interview results were made. For example, the prevalence of legal household piped water as a means of delineating spaces of urban poverty emerged through field visits and interviews with residents of grotas and favelas in Macieó. After a further filtering stage, during which excessively precise variables were manually removed from the categories (e.g., number of persons employed in emergency medical services who earn less than 1.5 times the minimum wage), a list of 93 variables remained. In the next phase, the results of the qualitative analysis were linked to potential explanatory variables using hand-drawn mind maps and a simple Likert scale to represent suitability in Microsoft Excel, where a variable’s score out of ten represented its heuristically-assessed suitability as determined by the first two authors and the final author. The most prevalent or central variables from the mind maps and the highest-scoring variables from the Likert ranking were then independently evaluated for their suitability for modelling through further discussions in light of the results of qualitative data collection, resulting in 31 candidate explanatory variables, which were entered into preliminary linear regression models using a stepwise parameterisation to explore effects and familiarise the authors with patterns in the data. Further discussion with the two co-authors from Alagoas and the removal of variables exhibiting excessive multicollinearity resulted in a further reduction to six final predictor variables: male population, persons without elementary school completion, households with reported income, divorced persons, number of persons whose place of employment is outside their municipality of residence, and households without piped water. The selected predictors were then standardised by resident population or number of households where appropriate and mapped by municipality using the software package QGIS (v.3.10.4). Manual data validation and correction was conducted prior to modelling and no transformations were necessary."

Victimization can persistently concentrate in a small number of neighborhoods, while others experience very little violence. Theorists have pointed to one possible explanation as the ability of groups to control violence using social capital. Researchers have shown this association at the U.S. county, state, and national levels. Few studies, however, have examined the relationship between neighborhood social capital and violence over time. This study uses longitudinal data to ask whether neighborhood social capital both predicts and is influenced by firearm victimization over 3 years in Philadelphia. The results of several regression analyses suggest that trusting others and firearm victimization are inversely related over time.

Surgery, 168(4), 671–675. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.05.016","Background: More than 30,000 Americans die every year of firearm-related injuries. Gun violence is frequently addressed by law enforcement and policing, as opposed to public health interventions that might address poverty or deprivation. Our goal was to evaluate the past 20 years of gunshot wound injury demographics seen at our level I academic trauma center and create a risk map model correlating gunshot wound incidence with area deprivation. Methods: Patients admitted for gunshot wound-related injuries between 1996 and 2017 were identified using our trauma registry. Demographic and injury data were extracted and analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to identify predictors of mortality. Geographic information system mapping of incident location and home address was completed to identify zip code hot spots of high gunshot wound incidence. Area Deprivation Indices, which reflect local income or poverty, housing, education, and employment were used as a marker of relative economic disadvantage. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relationship between Area Deprivation Indices score and gunshot wound rate. Results: A total of 2,413 patients with gunshot wounds were evaluated. The cohort had a mean age of 28.8 ± 11.5 and was 89.6% male. Mean Injury Severity Score was 11 ± 12.5. gunshot wounds were most frequently a result of assault (91.1%), followed by unintentional injury (3.4%). Geographic information systems mapping revealed significant clustering of gunshot wounds. The areas with highest per capita incidence of gunshot wounds was strongly correlated with Area Deprivation Indices (0.594, P < .001). Conclusion: Geographic regions of known lower socioeconomic resources have higher incidence of gunshot wounds in our community. Both Area Deprivation Indices and gunshot wound incidents in these distressed communities remained unchanged throughout the past 20 years, despite law enforcement crime suppression efforts. Gunshot wounds appear to be a symptom of area deprivation, similar to failing schools and poor health outcomes. Efforts to decrease poverty and community capacity-building may help alleviate this area deprivation.","In a collaboration between the obstetrics and gynaecology department, midwifery department and psychology department of Babol University of Medical Sciences, a project was set up to screen for domestic violence among women attending public obstetrics, gynaecology and family planning health services in Babol city, Islamic Republic of Iran. The goal was to provide information for a policy calling for routine screening for domestic violence. The first stage of the project was a 4-hour in-service education for midwifery staff which trained midwives in project clinics to screen and identify of victims of domestic violence and to prevent intimate partner violence among women through identifying possible victims and counselling them. The second stage was to implement a screening questionnaire for domestic violence. For this study, a sample of women attending clinics of the public heath services in Babol city were interviewed about their experiences with intimate partner violence. Babol city was divided into 3 areas according to the socioeconomic status (SES) of the population (high, middle and low status areas) and 1 public health service clinic was selected from each of those 3 areas. We recruited patients attending obstetrics and gynaecology and family planning clinics. The inclusion criteria were married women who had a husband during the past year and who gave written informed consent to enter the study. Women are used to attending such clinics and often attend alone. Thus the refusal rate among the women was low. We started screening at the 3 clinics at the same time and continued until 800 women in each clinic were entered in the study. Thus, we recruited 2400 women from November 2002 to August 2003. The women were interviewed at the clinic by the midwife in a private room. The interview lasted between 30 and 50 minutes. The women were unaccompanied by either the husband or a female friend; women attending with their husbands were not entered in the study. As they were familiar with the midwives and they were interviewed in private, the women were generally free from fear. "
Do community characteristics predict alcohol-related crime?,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21546376/,"Breen, C., Shakeshaft, A., Slade, T., Love, S., D'Este, C., & Mattick, R. P. (2011). Do community characteristics predict alcohol-related crime?. Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire), 46(4), 464–470. https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/agr040","Aims: Alcohol-related crime is a substantial community problem. There is evidence to suggest that certain geographic areas experience higher rates of alcohol-related crime and that both individual and community factors are associated with alcohol-related crime. There is limited research at the community level despite communities being the target of interventions designed to reduce alcohol-related harm. This study aims to determine whether there are differences in alcohol-related crime at the community level and examines whether certain community characteristics are associated with increased alcohol-related crime. Methods: Routinely collected police data from 20 rural communities in New South Wales, Australia were analysed. The ratio of alcohol to non-alcohol-related criminal incidents was used as a proxy for alcohol-related crime. Predictor variables were population-adjusted community characteristics, including demographic and resource variables. Results: Regression analyses suggest that there are differences between communities in alcohol-related crime. Less socioeconomic disadvantage and more GPs and licensed premises (pubs and clubs) are associated with greater alcohol-related crime at the community level. Conclusions: Decreasing the socioeconomic well-being of a community is not appropriate; however, introducing additional taxes to increase the cost of alcohol may decrease consumption and therefore alcohol-related crime. Reducing or capping the number of licensed premises, specifically the number of pubs and clubs, may be an appropriate strategy to reduce alcohol-related crime in rural communities.","Communities Rural communities in NSW, Australia were considered for participation in the Alcohol Action in Rural Communities (AARC) project if they had an urban-centre locality population between 5000 and 20,000, were at least 100 km away from a major urban centre (population ≥ 100,000) and were not currently involved in another public health project for alcohol harm (n = 20). The population size of the communities that is defined by 2001 census Postal Area (POA) information ranged from ∼6500–29,000.Community variables Community-level variables were extracted from data available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. POA census data for 2001 for the 20 communities were used as this study focuses on individuals' communities. In addition, the use of this geographic unit corresponds with the unit for the outcome measure (crime). Information on the proportion of young males (aged 15–24 years) and the proportion of indigenous people was extracted from census data for each community (Australian Bureau of Statistics). Geographic characteristics were indexed through the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) score. ARIA scores incorporate the concept of remoteness based on the distance that people must travel by road to get to services centres (areas where they can access goods and services and interact socially). Mean scores for postcode were obtained (Australian Department of Health and Ageing). Low scores indicate greater accessibility (i.e. less remote). Socioeconomic characteristics of each postcode were indexed through the Socio-Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA) disadvantage deciles (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2004). The SEIFA disadvantage deciles are derived from census data and summarize the socioeconomic well-being of an area. It is the most general SEIFA score and includes all census variables that either reflect or measure disadvantages such as income, educational attainment, unemployment and wealth (e.g. owning a car, number of bedrooms in a dwelling). Low scores indicated high levels of disadvantage and high scores show relatively low disadvantage within the area. The score summarizes the socioeconomic well-being of an area, rather than any individual within that area. The number of licensed premises were extracted by postcode from information published by the NSW Office of Gaming and Racing in 2004 (Gaming and Racing A NSW Government Department, 2004). Due to evidence of differential harm associated with license type (Stockwell et al., 1992), the number of pubs and clubs, the number of wholesalers and retailers and the number other licensed premises (airport, function centres, motels, restaurant, theatre, vignerons and on-off-wine) were considered as distinct variables. The number of full-time police officers and highway patrol officers was collated from information provided by the Police Local Area Command. The number of general practitioners was obtained by searching the electronic telephone directory for each community and cross-checking with the relevant Divisions of General Practice. The proportion of individuals identified at drinking at risky levels for alcohol-related harm in the short and long-term (National Health and Medical Research Council, 2001) and those identified as having harmful or hazardous alcohol use as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (Saunders et al., 1993) were obtained for each community from a community survey 3017 randomly selected community members (Breen et al., 2010)."
Prediction of crime rate in urban neighborhoods based on machine learning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197621003080,,"As the impact of crime on the lives of residents has increased, there are a number of methods for predicting where crime will occur. They tend to explore only the association established between a single factor and the distribution of crime. In order to more accurately and quickly visualize and predict crime distribution in different neighborhoods, and to provide a basis for security planning and design by planning designers, this paper uses GAN neural networks to build a prediction model of city floor plans and corresponding crime distribution maps. We take Philadelphia as the research sample, use more than 2 million crime information of Philadelphia from 2006 to 2018 to draw the crime hotspot distribution map, and collect the corresponding map of Philadelphia, and train the model for predicting the crime rate of the city with more than two thousand sets of one-to-one corresponding images as the training set. When the training is complete, a floor plan can be fed directly to the model, and the model will immediately feed back a hotspot map reflecting the crime distribution. Using the untrained Philadelphia data as the test set, the model can accurately predict crime concentration areas and the predicted crime concentration areas are similar to the concentration areas considered in previous studies. With the feedback from the model, the city layout can be adjusted and the crime rate can be greatly reduced when the simulated city planner tunes into the city plan. In addition the ideas in this paper can be applied as a set of methodologies to predict other relevant urban characteristic parameters and visualize them.","Given a sample with a list of municipal buildings and grassy areas (Fig. 7-a), the model accurately predicts the different impacts of municipal-building distribution and planning of roads within grassy areas on crime rates, achieving the same level of accuracy it has with main roads in non-residential areas. This indicates the model comprehensively considers the factors that lead to crime and forms an accurate and complex prediction model. Even though, in the mid-training period (Fig. 7-b), the model’s prediction of areas with low crime rates is lower than the real value, it accurately predicts the high crime-rate points caused by municipal buildings and green park spaces. For other areas that include both municipal buildings and residential buildings, the model also makes accurate judgments. Therefore, it can be concluded that artificial intelligence quickly and accurately learns some factors that are likely to cause high crime rates. Figs. 7-c, d, and e are related to neatly arranged townhouses, loosely distributed residential buildings, and ordered villas. For these residential areas with obvious distribution rules, the predicted crime rate images generated by artificial intelligence are often uniform and accurate. Even if there are small lawns on the blocks or large buildings occupying entire blocks, the high crime-rate points at the corners of blocks can be predicted and displayed. However, as the building density decreases, the prediction of the crime distribution in the relatively empty villa areas becomes inaccurate. In addition, there are some exceptions in the layouts that the model can accurately predict. Although Fig. 7-f contains neat townhouses, due to the emergence of municipal buildings in the area, the artificial intelligence erroneously predicts the distribution and intensity of high crime rates. This may be in light of special architectural functions and geopolitical conditions, or even non-architectural reasons; alternatively, it may be caused by the lack of comparable data for learning neural networks. Figs. 7-g and h are samples containing large grassy areas and suburbs with relatively isolated roads. The high crime rate near the grass and roads in the figure is not predicted, which may be explained by the fact that there are few specified elements in this type of map, such as the number of intersections and the number of buildings around the road. This kind of road has too little reference information for an artificial intelligence to learn from, leading it to misjudge the crime rate. When the traffic conditions are complicated, the model’s prediction of crime distribution also becomes less accurate. For instance, Fig. 7-i is a sample with main roads and complex traffic. Fig. 7-j is a sample with highly complicated roads within the residential blocks. Fig. 7-k is an irregularly shaped block with dead-end streets. In traffic-intensive areas, not least the main roads around empty spaces, the accuracy of the generated image is relatively low. Even in the middle and late training periods, there are still cases of the model misjudging high crime-rate points and neglecting some low crime-rate points. This may be caused by the jumping randomness and the more complicated distribution of crimes as the traffic complexity increases. The presence of the dead-end streets and irregular blocks leads the model to generate inaccurate crime predictions because these two situations do not appear often in the training data, and there is a limited number of these sorts of learning samples. When more related city samples are learned, the accuracy of this type of street judgment will improve. Generally speaking, for areas in the training set with high building density and moderate traffic density, the model can generate more accurate crime heat maps. As the building density decreases, the accuracy of the model prediction decreases. Road with too high or too low a density, as well as unconventional blocks and road types, are less likely to result in accurate predictions from the model. However, the overall accuracy of the GAN model is satisfactory, indicating a high degree of training completion."
Studying neighborhood crime across different macro spatial scales: The case of robbery in 4 cities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049089X16307931,,"Whereas there is a burgeoning literature focusing on the spatial distribution of crime events across neighborhoods or micro-geographic units in a specific city, the present study expands this line of research by selecting four cities that vary across two macro-spatial dimensions: population in the micro-environment, and population in the broader macro-environment. We assess the relationship between measures constructed at different spatial scales and robbery rates in blocks in four cities: 1) San Francisco (high in micro- and macro-environment population); 2) Honolulu (high in micro- but low in macro-environment population); 3) Los Angeles (low in micro- but high in macro-environment population); 4) Sacramento (low in micro- and macro-environment population). Whereas the socio-demographic characteristics of residents further than ½ mile away do not impact robbery rates, the number of people up to 2.5 miles away are related to robbery rates, especially in the two cities with smaller micro-environment population, implying a larger spatial scale than is often considered. The results show that coefficient estimates differ somewhat more between cities differing in micro-environment population compared to those differing based on macro-environment population. It is therefore necessary to consider the broader macro-environment even when focusing on the level of crime across neighborhoods or micro-geographic units within an area.","3.2.1. Outcome variable Based on the Uniform Crime Reports provided by each police agency, we coded robbery events, and then geocoded and aggregated them to the constituent blocks. The outcome variable refers to the computed totals over the three years (2009-11) in order to smooth year-to-year fluctuations in robberies. We used robberies because: 1) they are usually a well-reported crime type; 2) reporting typically provides relatively accurate day and time information on the incident; 3) both offenders and targets typically move prior to a robbery event, so it is a particularly spatially influenced crime type.3.2.1.

Key predictor variables We account for the presence of persons in the nearby environment in several manners. First, we take into account the number of residents by constructing a measure of the block-level population as logged population. We capture nonlinear effects by also including the quadratic version of this variable (we tested a cubic functional form, but this term was never statistically significant). The daytime population is impacted by the presence of employees in the area, so we constructed a measure of total employees in the area as logged total employees (Boessen, 2014, Steenbeek et al., 2012). We also included the quadratic version of this variable to capture nonlinearities. The employee data comes from Mint Business data, which provides the address and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for businesses across the U.S. We geocoded the establishments and placed them in the representative census block. Given that retail employees not only represent persons in the area, but also represent many other persons in the form of patrons of these stores, we constructed a measure of the retail employees in the area (2-digit NAICS codes 44 and 45) as logged retail employees. Although shops themselves can be targets, we focus on the number of employees given that they operate as a proxy for the ambient population in an area, which is of particular interest to us here. Although some existing research has focused on specific types of retail locations as potential “risky facilities”, we do not do so here because 1) creating many categories of establishments is outside the scope of the present research; and 2) existing research typically indicates that risky facilities have a very micro effect on the local block and therefore would be less likely to have an effect at broader scales as tested here. We also constructed a quadratic version of this variable to test for nonlinear effects. We included measures to capture the characteristics of people in the block and nearby area. We capture the possible effect of concentrated disadvantage with a measure that combines four variables using factor analysis to create factor scores: the percent at or below 125% of the poverty level, the percent single parent households, the average household income, and the percent with at least a bachelor's degree (the latter two are reverse coded) (α = 0.77 in blocks and α = 0.86 in the surrounding area). Given that only the single parent household variable is available at the block level, the other measures are imputed using the synthetic estimation approach described in Boessen and Hipp (2015).1 Residential stability is captured with a measure that standardized and combined variables of the percent homeowners, average length of residence, and the percent same house five years previously (α = 0.70 in blocks and α = 0.80 in the surrounding area). The presence of racial minorities is captured with measures of percent Black, percent Latino, and percent Asian residents (with percent White and other races as the reference category). Racial/ethnic heterogeneity is measured based on the Herfindahl Index combining five racial/ethnic groups (Asian, Black, Latino, White, and other race). Given that vacant units can be crime attractors (Boessen and Hipp, 2015: 402), we include a measure of the percent vacant units. We account for the prime offending ages by including a measure of the percent aged between 15 and 29. A measure of income inequality is constructed in four sized egohoods: ¼ mile, ½ mile, ¾ mile, and 1 mile. Egohoods are constructed based on the block, and then constructing a buffer around the block of various sizes in which all blocks within the buffer are included, but do not include a distance decay effect. We used egohoods rather than buffers given evidence from previous research that inequality shows a much stronger relationship with crime when measured in egohoods rather than with a distance decay (Hipp and Boessen, 2013). This measure was constructed by first assigning household incomes to the midpoint of their reported range, log transforming these values, multiplying them by the number of observations in each bin, computing the mean logged household income, and then computing the standard deviation of income based on these values. We tested these measures in separate models to assess which sized egohood provided the strongest results."
A machine learning-based method for the large-scale evaluation of the qualities of the urban environment,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516301831,,"Given the present size of modern cities, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the qualities of the urban space at every street corner. Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as ‘where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration’ and ‘in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing’. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents.","Over the last four decades, there have been constant efforts in measuring the physical qualities of the urban environment that would potentially be perceptually meaningful. According to Stamps (2000, p. preface), there had been ‘275 relevant empirical studies, covering over 12,000 stimuli and more than 41,000 respondents’ by 2000. In a more recent review on this topic, Ewing and Handy (2009) found 51 perceptual-related qualities that were analysed. Wohlwill (1976, p. 61) referred to two ways of measuring physical attributes of the environment: the physical approach and the judgemental approach. Because the perceptual-related qualities are usually more qualitative ones, they are more commonly measured using the judgemental approach, which resorts human judges to assess these qualities (Nasar, 1983, Wohlwill, 1976, p. 61). In an attempt to quantify and operationalise these human-judged qualities, Ewing and Handy (2009) employed an innovative method and produced a series of models linking concrete physical features with more abstract perceptual qualities. Our work is similar to that of Ewing and Handy in that we also aim to model the expert judgements on the qualities of urban environment based on very basic attributes. However, the proposed big-data-based machine learning method can be more automatic and labour saving. Previously, most computer vision algorithms related to places focused on technical tasks such as scene classification or parsing scene images into constituent objects and background elements (Madhavan et al., 2006, Ordonez and Berg, 2014). Building upon that, a few interesting research studies into the perceptual and cultural aspects of urban images have emerged in recent years. In the seminal work of ‘What makes Paris look like Paris’, Doersch et al. (2012) dealt with the identification of local architectural identity by proposing a discriminative clustering approach that automatically discovers geographically representative elements from Google Street View images. With regard to that, there are also studies on the automatic classification of architectural styles by capturing the morphological characteristics, which can be further applied to the identification of architectural style mix and style transformation over time (Goel et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2015, Shalunts et al., 2011, Shalunts et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2014). The most relevant works to the present study are those that aim at understanding people's perceptions of urban scenes, which are usually analysed by crowd-sourcing rating on urban images. Quercia et al. (2014) identified several aesthetic informative elements that positively (e.g. the amount of greenery) or negatively (e.g. broad streets, fortress-like buildings) affect people's perception of beauty, quietness and happiness. Ordonez and Berg (2014) modelled the perception for wealth, uniqueness and safety judged from street view images and validated the results against local income and crime statistics. The perception of safety was also modelled by Naik et al. (2014) and Porzi, Rota Bulò, Lepri, and Ricci (2015) and was proved to be consistent with the actual socio-economic indicators (Naik, Kominers, Raskar, Glaeser, & Hidalgo, 2015)."
Crime in relation to urban design. Case study: The Greater Cairo Region,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090447915001379,,"Crime is a part of any social system and known to human communities since its origins. It differs from community to another, even within one community it doesn’t occur equally in all places and nor by the same way. It is also concentrated in some places more than others, sometimes increases, sometimes decreases, etc. Previous researches have proved that crime rate has significant correlation with different social factors: education levels, poverty rates and lack of social organization, while others have drawn the attention to its relation with the built environment. They proposed that crime occurs in places where both opportunities and criminals are available. The role of this paper is to identify urban circumstances related to crime occurrence within the Greater Cairo Region, and to propose different ways to reduce these crimes. Consecutively, agglomeration’s main districts were scrutinized according to social analysis, street-network pattern and land-use.","In this part, crime rates were correlated with different social factors including illiteracy rate, unemployment rate, and internal migration studies, and these factors can be considered as an indicator of social deterioration within any society, which is primarily responsible for generating criminals and increasing crime rates. In this part, crime rates were correlated with different land uses which can be classified into activity uses (represented by commercial areas), idle uses (represented by cemeteries, deserts and military areas), and a mix of them (represented by industrial areas, in addition to the study of the residential areas themselves, including some of the formal housing areas (the old deteriorated residential areas, public housing and shelter “El-EWAA” housing areas) and the informal housing areas). Based on previous studies, land uses can provide a good opportunity for criminals to commit their crimes by reducing movements and activities or exaggerating them. 4.1. Social analysis. The main purpose of this analysis was to identify the relationship between different social factors and crime rate. The methodology used to understand this relation depends on the correlation between the latter and the rate of each of these factors within the studied districts. According to the mentioned methodology, results showed that total crime rate was significantly and negatively correlated with all studied social factors except the internal migration rate, where a negative but not significant correlation exists. This also applied to person and property crimes. So, it can be concluded that districts with high socially deteriorated residents have low crimes rate. Table 1 shows the correlation and “t” values over the agglomeration districts"
Nonlinear relationships and interaction effects of an urban environment on crime incidence: Application of urban big data and an interpretable machine learning method,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210670723000306,,"While environmental criminology suggests that crime and the urban environment are closely related, some studies suggest a nonlinear relationship. This study analyzed the relationship between crime incidence and the urban environment using urban big data such as points-of-interest (POI), smart civil complaint data, and street image data from Naver Street View in Seoul, Korea. For analysis, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method have been used. The analysis results confirmed a nonlinear relationship comprising inflection points between crime incidence and the urban environment. Also, this study identified the interaction effects of urban environmental variables on crime incidence. Finally, the hierarchical clustering method was used to identify the contributions of various aspects of the urban environments to crime incidence. Then, this study provides policy implications to prevent potential criminal activities and promote public safety for sustainable cities and societies.","Seoul is a metropolitan city in Korea and is an area of frequent crime due to its high population density. Seoul includes land uses such as residential, commercial, and industrial. Therefore, this study aimed to confirm the characteristics of the urban environment in terms of crime incidence, centering on a target location. The case study area of Seoul was divided into 10,125 units of a 250-meter grid (Fig. 1). The data include the incidence density of five major crimes: violence, theft, murder, robbery, and sexual assault. This study uses total crime incidence of these five major crimes as well as the individual incidence of only violence, theft, and sexual assault, as murder and robbery occur at a very low incidence in Seoul. As independent variables, demographic and socioeconomic variables and physical environment variables were used. Therefore, using the Spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA), the street network structure was identified, and variables were established based on urban big data of POI, civil complaints, and urban landscape characteristics. To select the best machine learning model, data were divided into training and test data at a ratio of 80:20. This study attempted to adjust the model design to address overfitting issues using a 10-fold cross-validation process and hyperparameter tuning of the Bayesian optimization method (Akiba et al., 2019). Next, various machine learning and statistical models were compared and analyzed, and the model with the highest accuracy was selected. Finally, the machine learning methodology identified important urban environmental variables in predicting crime incidence. Furthermore, the point of change in the effect of each environmental variable was derived quantitatively using a nonlinear relationship and interaction effects of the urban environment. A cluster analysis between crime incidence and urban environments was performed. The study presents a quantitative proposal for use in urban planning and establishment of policies based on an understanding of the environment in which crimes occur."
Crime prediction through urban metrics and statistical learning,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437118304059,"""Luiz G.A. Alves, Haroldo V. Ribeiro, Francisco A. Rodrigues, Crime prediction through urban metrics and statistical learning, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, Volume 505, 2018, Pages 435-443, ISSN 0378-4371, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2018.03.084.""","Understanding the causes of crime is a longstanding issue in researcher’s agenda. While it is a hard task to extract causality from data, several linear models have been proposed to predict crime through the existing correlations between crime and urban metrics. However, because of non-Gaussian distributions and multicollinearity in urban indicators, it is common to find controversial conclusions about the influence of some urban indicators on crime. Machine learning ensemble-based algorithms can handle well such problems. Here, we use a random forest regressor to predict crime and quantify the influence of urban indicators on homicides. Our approach can have up to 97% of accuracy on crime prediction, and the importance of urban indicators is ranked and clustered in groups of equal influence, which are robust under slightly changes in the data sample analyzed. Our results determine the rank of importance of urban indicators to predict crime, unveiling that unemployment and illiteracy are the most important variables for describing homicides in Brazilian cities. We further believe that our approach helps in producing more robust conclusions regarding the effects of urban indicators on crime, having potential applications for guiding public policies for crime control.","For our analysis, we choose the number of homicides at the city level as the crime indicator to be predicted. Homicide is the ultimate expression of violence against a person, and thus a reliable crime indicator because it is almost always reported. In Brazil, the report of this particular crime to the Public Health System is compulsory, and these data are aggregated at the city level and made freely available by the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Public Health System — DATASUS [53]. As possible predictor variables of crime, we select 10 urban indicators (also at the city level) available from the Brazilian National Census that took place in 2000. They are: child labor (fraction of the population aged 10 to 15 years who is working or looking for work), elderly population (citizens aged 60 years or older), female population, gross domestic product (GDP), illiteracy (citizens aged 15 years or older who are unable to read and write at least a single ticket in the language they know), family income (average household incomes of family residents, in Brazilian currency), male population, population, sanitation (number of houses that have piped water and sewerage), and unemployment (citizens aged 16 years or older who are without working or looking for work). We have also considered as possible crime-predicting variables the number of traffic accidents and suicides (these data are also aggregated at the city level and from the same year of the census). We have chosen these indicators because they are common in studies correlating crime with socioeconomic indicators [27]. We have further included the number of homicides in the year 2000 as a predictor for homicides in 2010 for investigating a possible autocorrelated behavior. There are thus 13 urban indicators (including also the homicide indicator) from the year 2000 in our dataset that will be used as predictors of the number of homicides 10 years later. We choose a time interval of 10 years because the characteristic time for changes in social indicators has been estimated to be of the order of decades [33,35]. However, we also investigate how the accuracy changes as the time-lag increases from one to ten years considering homicide data from the years 2001 to 2010."
Prediction of crime occurrence from multi-modal data using deep learning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5402948/,"Kang HW, Kang HB. Prediction of crime occurrence from multi-modal data using deep learning. PLoS One. 2017 Apr 24;12(4):e0176244. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0176244. PMID: 28437486; PMCID: PMC5402948.","In recent years, various studies have been conducted on the prediction of crime occurrences. This predictive capability is intended to assist in crime prevention by facilitating effective implementation of police patrols. Previous studies have used data from multiple domains such as demographics, economics, and education. Their prediction models treat data from different domains equally. These methods have problems in crime occurrence prediction, such as difficulty in discovering highly nonlinear relationships, redundancies, and dependencies between multiple datasets. In order to enhance crime prediction models, we consider environmental context information, such as broken windows theory and crime prevention through environmental design. In this paper, we propose a feature-level data fusion method with environmental context based on a deep neural network (DNN). Our dataset consists of data collected from various online databases of crime statistics, demographic and meteorological data, and images in Chicago, Illinois. Prior to generating training data, we select crime-related data by conducting statistical analyses. Finally, we train our DNN, which consists of the following four kinds of layers: spatial, temporal, environmental context, and joint feature representation layers. Coupled with crucial data extracted from various domains, our fusion DNN is a product of an efficient decision-making process that statistically analyzes data redundancy. Experimental performance results show that our DNN model is more accurate in predicting crime occurrence than other prediction models.","Environmental context information For example, consider locations l1 and l2 belonging to census tract Cn, {l1, l2, ⋯, lm} ∈ {Cn} If l1 is an ordered and clean location, such as modern buildings and clean parks, whereas l2 is a disordered and dirty location, such as industrial buildings and graffiti-marked alleys, then the probability of a crime occurring at the two locations is likely to be quite different. That is, certain locations have different crime occurrence probabilities according to environmental context information. However, prior studies used only information about the surrounding area, such as population, race, income, and education data using multiple datasets; they did not consider environmental context information. Therefore, to accurately predict crime occurrences, we should consider environmental context information. Because image data is unstructured data, we extracted features from image data collected from Google Street View images to provide our prediction model with environmental context information (Image data are in dataset menu of the site http://cvml.catholic.ac.kr). Although the image data were not collected in real time, they are considered sufficient to provide the prediction model with relevant environmental context information. We extracted features from the image data by employing Alexnet [31], which showed good performance in terms of image classification."
Neighborhood Socioeconomic Disadvantage and the Shape of the Age–Crime Curve,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222502/,"Fabio, A., Tu, L. C., Loeber, R., & Cohen, J. (2011).

American journal of public health, 101 Suppl 1(Suppl 1), S325–S332. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2010.300034","Objectives. We sought to better determine the way in which neighborhood disadvantage affects the shape of the age–crime curve. Methods. We used data from the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS), a 14-year longitudinal study, to compare the age–crime curves of individuals in neighborhoods of different disadvantage. We visually compared observed age–crime curves, and then used generalized linear mixed models to test for differences in curve parameters. Results. Adjusted for individual risk factors, the mixed models found that the parameters for interactions of neighborhood disadvantage with both linear age and quadratic age were significant (P < .05) and consistent with higher and longer age–crime curves in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. This implied that compared with boys in advantaged neighborhoods, rates of violence among boys in disadvantaged neighborhoods rose to higher levels that were sustained significantly longer. Conclusions. These results suggested that residing in a disadvantaged neighborhood during early adolescence may have an enduring effect on the shape of the age–crime curve throughout an individual's life.","Participants were from the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS), a 14-year longitudinal study of delinquency.19 Boys attending the 1st, 4th, and 7th grades in the Pittsburgh Public School system during the 1987–1988 school year were randomly selected, resulting in 1517 boys (503 in the youngest cohort, 508 in the middle, and 506 in the oldest). A detailed description of the PYS study can be found elsewhere.19 We limited our analysis to the oldest sample, which provided the broadest age range to assess the age–crime curve. The PYS oversampled high-risk boys. We presented unweighted analyses for sample description and weighted multivariate analyses to represent the population. The assessment of race in public health research is one of complexity. Many studies have found relationships between race and youth violence.28 However, research has shown that this relationship was spurious and that the association of race and violence was due in large part to the confounding of socioeconomic disadvantage.29,30 As Kreiger wrote, “Despite good intentions, however, the suggestion to omit ‘race’ and rely solely on ‘class’ ignores not only the persistence of racism but also a growing body of evidence that interpersonal and structural discrimination, including but not restricted to their economic repercussions, harms health across the life-course.”31 To be able to adequately understand the complex relationship between race and violence, we felt that it was important to include race as a variable in the analysis. We did not assert that race per se was a risk factor. Rather, we treated African American race of environmental, socioeconomic, or psychosocial risk, for which we wished to control. Race was self-identified by the child's parent or caretaker at screening using an open ended question."

Frontiers in big data, 6, 1124526. https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2023.1124526","Urban agglomerations are constantly and rapidly evolving ecosystems, with globalization and increasing urbanization posing new challenges in sustainable urban development well summarized in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The advent of the digital age generated by modern alternative data sources provides new tools to tackle these challenges with spatio-temporal scales that were previously unavailable with census statistics. In this review, we present how new digital data sources are employed to provide data-driven insights to study and track (i) urban crime and public safety; (ii) socioeconomic inequalities and segregation; and (iii) public health, with a particular focus on the city scale.","Reducing inequalities is of crucial importance to guarantee a more sustainable and just future for our cities and societies. Indeed, socioeconomic inequalities and income segregation threaten access to health and negatively impact health population levels (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2006; Pickett and Wilkinson, 2015), prevent equal access to educational opportunities (Quillian, 2014; Logan and Burdick-Will, 2016), and hinder social and economic development (Neves et al., 2016). Moreover, they are intimately related to opportunities offered by neighborhoods (Sampson, 2012, 2019; Chetty et al., 2016; Manduca and Sampson, 2019; Hedefalk and Dribe, 2020) and human movements and interactions (Eagle et al., 2010; Chetty et al., 2016, 2022a,b; Wang et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2020). Before the advent of the digital era, socioeconomic inequalities were studied through surveys and census data. However, while census data provide a large-scale representativeness of the population, it lacks the ability to capture and provide an up-to-date picture of cities' dynamics and citizens' behaviors, routines, and habits (Lazer et al., 2009). As previously discussed, census data are collected every few years and are made publicly available several months after they were collected (Lazer et al., 2009). Instead, digital data provide alternative data sources that allow capturing different facets of human behavior: human interactions, human movements, and human encounters are just a few examples of human behavior which may play an essential role in investigating inequalities and segregation and that nowadays can be studied by means of mobile phone data (i.e., CDRs, GPS traces, etc.) and other digital traces (e.g., credit card transactions) (Lazer et al., 2009, 2020). In what follows, we discuss how several researchers, from economics and computational social science, have started using alternative data sources to study the daily behaviors and routines associated with socioeconomic inequalities and segregation in cities. As more people are moving to cities, governments have to deal with novel challenges like gentrification, unaffordability, segregation, and inequality (Glaeser et al., 2001; Florida, 2017). The place where a person lives can have substantial impacts on health (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2006), economic opportunities (Chetty et al., 2014, 2016), infrastructure and services accessibility (Glaeser et al., 2001; Reid et al., 2016; Florida, 2017), and many other aspects, both at a city and national scale (Chetty et al., 2014; Shelton et al., 2015). Thus, measuring inequalities and segregation with timely and accurate data is of paramount importance, and alternative data sources and ubiquitous technologies are starting to play a central role in deeply analyzing factors and behaviors associated to inequalities such as environmental inequalities (Brazil, 2022; Dass et al., 2022), social mixing and income segregation (Shelton et al., 2015; Moro et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2023), and community resilience (Hong et al., 2021)."

International journal of injury control and safety promotion, 25(4), 443–448. https://doi.org/10.1080/17457300.2018.1467461","Identifying geographic areas and time periods of increased violence is of considerable importance in prevention planning. This study compared the performance of multiple data sources to prospectively forecast areas of increased interpersonal violence. We used 2011–2014 data from a large metropolitan county on interpersonal violence (homicide, assault, rape and robbery) and forecasted violence at the level of census block-groups and over a one-month moving time window. Inputs to a Random Forest model included historical crime records from the police department, demographic data from the US Census Bureau, and administrative data on licensed businesses. Among 279 block groups, a model utilizing all data sources was found to prospectively improve the identification of the top 5% most violent block-group months (positive predictive value = 52.1%; negative predictive value = 97.5%; sensitivity = 43.4%; specificity = 98.2%). Predictive modelling with simple inputs can help communities more efficiently focus violence prevention resources geographically.","To predict the future occurrence of violence at the block group level we assembled three main classes of potential predictors to test their relative contributions to the model: (1) historical crime data, (2) neighbourhood demographic characteristics and (3) local business information. First, for historical crime information, we created monthly lagged variables going back 24 months for each block group that includes the total number of violent crimes. We also created 24 months of lagged variables for property crimes (burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft) to use as a predictor in our model. In addition to lags at the specified number of months, lagged variables were created that included the cumulative number of violence- and property-related crimes at each time point. All crime predictors were continuous variables. Second, to assemble block group demographic variables, the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) was used (United States Census Bureau. American Community Survey (ACS), 2016). The ACS includes the most detailed measures of citizen demographics available; however, results for such variables are present as five-year averages (2010– 2014) due to the need to produce stable estimates within small geographic areas. Thus, the demographic variables included help to inform the baseline, chronic level of violence risk and could contribute to short-term violence risk through their interactions with other variables; however, the values of such predictors are stable through the study period. For this study, the 20 ACS variables with the highest correlation coefficient with the number of violent crimes in a block group were selected for further exploration."
"Housing Supply and How It Is Related to Social Inequalities—Air Pollution, Green Spaces, Crime Levels, and Poor Areas—In Catalonia",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138561/,"Perafita, X., & Saez, M. (2023). Housing Supply and How It Is Related to Social Inequalities-Air Pollution, Green Spaces, Crime Levels, and Poor Areas-In Catalonia. International journal of environmental research and public health, 20(8), 5578. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20085578","We carried out a search of over 12,000 houses offered on the rental market in Catalonia and assessed the possibility of families below the poverty threshold being able to rent these homes. In this regard, we wanted to evaluate whether the economic situation of families is able to influence their social environment, surroundings, and safety. We observed how their economic situation can allow families the possibility of developing a life without exposure to health risks, and how economic constraints result in disadvantages in several areas of life. The results show how families at risk of poverty live in less favourable conditions and experience a widening of different gaps, with current prices leading to a possible poverty trap for the most disadvantaged groups. The higher the percentage of the population below the threshold, the lower the possibility of not being able to rent a house compared to areas with a lower prevalence of population below the threshold. This association was observed both when considering the risk linearly and non-linearly. Linearly, the probability of not renting a house was reduced by 8.36% for each 1% increase in the prevalence of population at risk of extreme poverty. In the second, third and fourth percentage quartiles, the probability of not being able to rent a house decreased by 21.13%, 48.61%, and 57.79%, respectively. In addition, the effect was different inside and outside of metropolitan areas, with the former showing a decrease of 19.05% in the probability of renting a house, whereas outside metropolitan areas the probability increased by 5.70%.","We used a cross-sectional observational design, and the data were extracted from multiple databases in September 2021 to study accessibility. The area of study consisted of the geolocated information of each home combined with the information from the small areas (either municipality or district), to enable access to the most granular information possible. The study is based on data from households for rent in September 2021. In Catalonia, as in the rest of Spain, only municipalities with 75,000 inhabitants or more are divided into districts. The districts, although they are an administrative division, group neighbourhoods with noticeable homogeneity in terms of socioeconomic variables (similar population density, similar disposable income, similar inequality index, etc.), see Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4. In addition, the districts are the smallest administrative unit for which information is obtained for the variables of interest in this study (i.e., housing). The data used were extracted from different sources, all of them official, and translated into a dataset of more than 50 variables (see Supplementary Table S1). The sources used to carry out the study were: Statistical Institute of Catalonia (IDESCAT), Cartographic and Geological Institute of Catalonia (ICGC), Government of Catalonia Open Data, the Mossos d’Esquadra police force, the National Statistics Institute (INE), Habitaclia estate agency and the Research Group on Statistics, Econometrics and Health (GRECS), University of Girona. 2.2.2. Homes A web scraping of the Habitaclia website was carried out to determine the number of rental homes available in Catalonia. After reviewing the main rental platforms in Spain the Habitaclia portal was chosen because it is not only one of the platforms with the largest number of homes registered on it, but its web structure also allowed greater ease of data extraction for subsequent processing and geolocation. Web Scraping Web scraping (a technique using software to extract public information from websites in an automated way) allowed the following features of each home to be obtained: price, m2, number of toilets and rooms, province, municipality, district, and street (where the house is located). The total number of rental homes in Catalonia was 12,796, comprising 11,320 homes in the province of Barcelona (mean: 58.35 homes, standard deviation: 566.23 homes, median: 4 homes, first quartile -Q1-: 2 homes, and third quartile -Q3-: 15.75 homes); 582 in the province of Girona (mean: 4.89 homes, standard deviation: 10.48 homes, median: 2 homes, first quartile -Q1-: 1 home, and third quartile -Q3-: 4.5 homes); 234 in the province of Lleida (mean: 4.03 homes, standard deviation: 17.82 homes, median: 1 home, first quartile -Q1-: 1 home, and third quartile -Q3-: 1 home); and 660 in the province of Tarragona (mean: 10.82 homes, standard deviation: 28.37 homes, median: 3 homes, first quartile -Q1-: 1 home, and third quartile -Q3-: 3 homes). Figure 5 and Figure 6 shows the result for geolocalised homes in the area of study. We specified generalised linear models (GLM) with variable response of a Bernoulli distribution, according to the possibility of renting a home, i.e., a variable indicating that, in September 2021, a specific home (of the 11.289 homes analysed) was not rented. We included as the following explanatory variables in the GLM: the percentage of the population at risk of social exclusion in the district of each home; the vegetation index (also in the district); the number of m2 of green area per inhabitant in the town of each home; dichotomous variables indicating if the values of the air pollutants (PM10, NO2 and O3) predicted in the district exceed the limits defined by the WHO; and the number of known crimes in the district of each home. We also controlled for the control variables defined above."
